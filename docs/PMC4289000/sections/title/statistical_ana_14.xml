 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the plot level, we used a generalized linear model (GLM) with Gaussian error structure and identity link function to study the effects of region and host species identity on the mean number of eggs per plant. Intra-specific host plant density was included in the model as a covariate. The mean number of eggs per plant was log-transformed, and its variation among regions and host species was examined with analysis of deviance. We also examined models including the summed density of all other potential host plant species in the plots. However, inter-specific host plant density had no significant (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.25) effect on the mean number of eggs in a given species and was not included in the presented models.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the individual level, we used GLMs with binomial error structure and logit link function to study the effects of host region, size, and phenology on egg presence (0 or 1). The two predictor variables, size and phenology, were the principal components PC1 and PC2, respectively, extracted from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the traits plant size, inflorescence size, and phenological state. We used PC1 and PC2 instead of the traits because original trait values were correlated (Pearson, 
  <span class="italic">r</span> &gt; 0.25, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> ≤ 0.05). PC1 and PC2 explained 48.4 and 32.7% of the variance, respectively (accumulated explained variance = 81.1%). PC1 was positively correlated with the plant size and total number of flowers, whereas PC2 was correlated with the phenological state. PCA loadings for the three host plant traits are shown in Table 10.1007/s13280-014-0602-7 (Electronic Supplementary Material). As preliminary analyses detected significant interactions between region and traits for some species, we evaluated effects of trait variables in separate models for each region.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2008</a>). Multiple comparisons of means (Tukey contrasts) for the GLMs were made using the multcomp package (Hothorn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2008</a>). The PCA was carried out with SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.).
