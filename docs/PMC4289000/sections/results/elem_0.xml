  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average advancement of mean flight date of all 66 butterfly species was 0.36 days/year during the last two decades. Moreover, the mean flight date of the same investigated butterfly species showed a positive correlation with latitude (mean value is 1.20 days/degree of latitude). The advancement in mean flight date as well as the seasonal advancement at lower latitudes was both greater in 
   <span class="italic">A. cardamines</span> than in the vast majority of other butterfly species in the region. It has advanced its mean flight dates during the last two decades with a mean value of 1.02 days/year, which is among the top three of all investigated butterfly species (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). In addition, there are only 2 out of 66 species that show a steeper relationship between mean flight date and latitude than 
   <span class="italic">A. cardamines</span> (3.41 days/degree of latitude).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A comparison with the records of 
   <span class="italic">A. cardamines</span> during 2010 registered in the Swedish Species Gateway indicated that our census periods occurred 4–6 days after the peak flight period in all three regions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Together with the results of previous studies showing that the egg stage in the field lasts 7–10 days (Wiklund and Åhrberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1978</a>) and that ca. 80% of the eggs are laid during the first half of the flight season (Wiklund and Friberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2009</a>), this strongly suggests that our census provided accurate assessments of host use in all regions.
