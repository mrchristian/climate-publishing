 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Air pollution is an alteration of air quality due to natural or anthropogenic emissions of physical, chemical and biological substances. It’s the environmental factor with the largest impact on respiratory health in Europe [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. The lung is one of the major sites of interaction with environmental particulates. PM consists of three fractions: a coarse fraction, PM
  <sub>10-2,5</sub> (2,5-10 μm); a fine fraction PM
  <sub>2,5-0,1</sub> (2,5-0,1 μm); and ultrafine nanosize fraction, PM
  <sub>0,1</sub> (≤0,1 μm). The coarse fraction is considered responsible for hazards in the larger airways, whereas PM 
  <sub>2,5</sub> reaches the gas ex-change region. However only the smallest fraction, the nanosize particles, could penetrate in the alveoli through the air-blood tissue barrier into the capillaries, after being deposited on the alveolar wall. Besides entering tissues and cells in the lung, facilitated by the minute size, these particles may translocate through the blood circulation to all other organs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. Therefore, it is this fraction of PM that should be given particular attention as far as adverse health effects are concerned.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Air pollutants cause direct cellular injury or induce intracellular signaling pathways and transcription factors that are known to be sensitive to the oxidative stress [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Air pollution has been related to asthma. Outdoor air pollution exacerbates asthma in those patients who already have the condition [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. Outdoor levels of air pollutants have been associated with asthma incidence and prevalence (“the urban factor”) at the population level.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Particle pollution, vehicle exhaust and ground level ozone are the most important types of hazardous pollutants. Ozone is a powerful oxidant that has been associated with persistent structural airway and lung tissue damage, as well as with more severe asthma symptoms and increase in respiratory hospital admissions and deaths in Europe and the USA [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. It is estimated that there will be 1,500 more annual ozone associated deaths by the year 2020 in the UK alone [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Pollution models for climate change scenarios predict an increase in ozone concentrations over large areas, while the effect on particle concentrations is less clear [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. The short-term effects of ozone on daily mortality and respiratory disease are extensively studied, while there is only limited documentation of long-term effects on mortality [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate factors like temperature, wind, and precipitation play important roles in determining patterns and concentrations of air pollution over multiple scales in time and space. They operate through changes in air pollution emissions, transport, dilution, chemical transformation and deposition of air pollutants (particulate and gaseous like in particular secondary pollutants like ozone).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Today, there are tens of thousands of known or suspected air pollutants, sometimes acting in synergy each other as well as with other parameters (temperature, wind, etc). However, very few of them are monitored; only those covered by regulations. Within the premises, it can be found a cocktail of toxic chemical pollutants and allergens: paints, adhesives, flooring, cleaning products, dye waste, heaters and gas cooking, as well as other toxic compounds, such as dust from lead paint, radon and asbestos.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other forms of air pollution are represented by the excess of pollens and moulds. In addition, people are exposed to air pollution also within the premises such as houses, offices, schools where they spend between 80 and 90 % of their time, with its 3,000 compounds identified to date and its 5 billion particles per cigarette, tobacco smoke is unquestionably the most formidable air pollutants related to human activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Positive associations have been observed between urban air pollution and respiratory symptoms in children, and the literature contains many reports of a relation between motor vehicle exhausts and acute or chronic respiratory symptoms in children living near traffic [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Air pollution can negatively influence lung development in children and adolescents [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. Most studies suggested the adverse effects of air pollution on children’s lung function and respiratory symptoms. Deficits in lung function were associated with a correlated set of pollutants that included nitrogen dioxide, acid vapor, fine particulate matter (PM
  <sub>2,5</sub>), and elemental carbon. Deficits in lung function during young adulthood may increase the risk of respiratory conditions, such as episodic wheezing that occurs during a viral infection. However, the largest effects of pollution related deficits might occur later in life, since reduced lung function is a strong risk factor for complications and death during adulthood [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Moreover, PM can affect also the cardiovascular system. According to the British Heart Foundation, airborne particulate matter (PM) can increase the risk of CVD in three ways [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Firstly, PM can stimulate receptors in the lungs that disrupt the nervous system and cause changes to heart rhythm. Secondly, inhaled particles can cause inflammation of the lungs and then damage the cardiovascular system as inflammatory chemicals pass into the blood. At last, ultrafine particles may pass into the blood and directly affect blood vessels [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prediction about the effects of climate change on health-related air pollution is hampered by several limits: future emissions depend on numerous factors, such as population growth, economic development, energy use and production; current knowledge about weather effects on air pollution is still unsatisfactory; there is still a need of better emission inventories and observational datasets. As regards indoor pollution, indoor levels of air pollutants other than environmental tobacco smoking have also been related to asthma prevalence or symptoms by some studies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Consistent results support short-term (aggravation) and also long-term (prevalence augmentation) effects on asthma of poor air in indoor settings [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Environmental tobacco smoke is one of the most important risks for respiratory symptoms and diseases worldwide. The evidence is also reliable for indoor nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, which have been associated with asthma. Whereas formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds seem to be important pollutants in indoor settings, there are still few papers on asthma and bronchitis.
