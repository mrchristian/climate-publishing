 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Health effects of climate change include an increase in the prevalence of allergic respiratory diseases, exacerbations of chronic obstructive lung disease, premature mortality, and declines in lung function [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. Climate change, mediated by greenhouse gases, causes adverse health effects to the most vulnerable patient populations such as elderly, children, patients with chronic non-communicable diseases and those in distressed socioeconomic strata.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering these aspects governments worldwide and international organizations such as the World Health Organization and European Union are facing a growing problem of the respiratory effects induced by gaseous and particulate pollutants arising from motor vehicle emissions.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, climate change may significantly worsen health inequities within and among countries and put additional stress on poorer groups.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, strategies to reduce climate changes and air pollution are political in nature, but citizen and in particular health professionals and societies must raise their voices in the decision process to give strong support for clean policies on both national and international levels.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Policy changes are beginning to impact greenhouse gas production in many parts of the world.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These efforts are crucial for reducing future impacts, but because over-all global emissions continue to rise, adaptation to the impacts of future climate variability will also be required.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important advocay tool is the last encyclics letter of Pope Francis: 
  <span class="italic">“</span>There is an urgent need to develop policies so that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced, for example, substituting for fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy” [
