 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Like rapid urbanization, increasing climate change is of great concern to the Chinese government and people [
  <a rid="B42-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-12-11025">42</a>,
  <a rid="B43-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-12-11025">43</a>]. Many infectious disease agents such as viruses and bacteria, and vectors such as mosquitoes are influenced by seasonality and changes in temperature, rainfall and humidity [
  <a rid="B44-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-12-11025">44</a>]. It is widely understood that the process of rapid development and excessive human activities have caused an increase of 0.85 ± 0.2 °C in global mean temperature during the period from 1880 to 2012 [
  <a rid="B45-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-12-11025">45</a>]. The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC Fifth Assessment Report) has predicted an increase of 1.1–6.4 °C in the average global land and ocean surface temperature from 1990 to 2100 and highlighted the significant impact of the rising temperature on infectious disease transmission and human health [
  <a rid="B45-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-12-11025">45</a>]. In China the rapid economic development during the last few decades has been accompanied by unprecedented environmental changes with a warming climate and more frequent weather-related natural disasters [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-11025">46</a>]. Studies have found that the average surface temperature in China has risen by 1.3 °C over the past 58 years (1951–2008) [
  <a rid="B47-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-12-11025">47</a>]. Precipitation from 1900 to 2005 has declined in southern parts of China, but increased by 22%–33% in northwest China [
  <a rid="B45-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-12-11025">45</a>]. There have also been increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts, landslides, mudslides, and regional and mountain floods [
  <a rid="B42-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-12-11025">42</a>]. These changes in climate will likely favor the transmission of many climate-sensitive diseases, such as mosquito-borne and rodent-borne diseases by affecting the ecology of the diseases, impacting upon their distribution and the number of disease cases.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies in China have indicated an association between climatic factors and the incidence of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, and diseases with rodent reservoirs such as HFRS [
  <a rid="B48-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-12-11025">48</a>,
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-12-11025">49</a>,
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-12-11025">50</a>]. Malaria and dengue are mosquito-borne infectious diseases caused by parasites of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and dengue viruses, respectively [
  <a rid="B51-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-12-11025">51</a>,
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-12-11025">52</a>]. Climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall have been shown to be associated with the incidence of malaria and dengue via a changing impact on the lifecycles of mosquitoes and parasites, and virus replication [
  <a rid="B53-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-ijerph-12-11025">53</a>]. Higher temperature can shorten the duration of parasite and virus replication, enhance the reproduction rate of mosquitoes, and increase the frequency of blood feeding and contacts with humans, causing higher incidence of malaria and dengue. However, extremely high temperature may also disrupt mosquito breeding, kill the eggs and larvae, evaporate water in breeding sites and shorten the mosquito survival cycle, leading to a decline in disease incidence [
  <a rid="B44-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-12-11025">44</a>]. Likewise, rainfall influences the incidence of malaria and dengue. Increased rainfall favors mosquito development by providing aquatic breeding sites, subsequently increasing mosquito populations and the potential incidence of malaria and dengue [
  <a rid="B44-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-12-11025">44</a>]. Although excessive rainfall and flooding may destroy the existing mosquito breeding sites and restrict disease transmission in the short term, it is likely to create more breeding habitats for mosquitoes and increase disease incidence over time [
  <a rid="B44-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-12-11025">44</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The incidence of HFRS has also been associated with climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall and relative humidity. Warmer conditions can increase activities of rodents and the rate of rodent reproduction, thus leading to an increase in the incidence of HFRS [
  <a rid="B54-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-12-11025">54</a>,
  <a rid="B55-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-12-11025">55</a>,
  <a rid="B56-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-ijerph-12-11025">56</a>]. However, hot and dry conditions and lower relative humidity may increase the mortality of rodents, reduce the survival rate of hantaviruses in the reservoir, and thus curb the transmission of HFRS [
  <a rid="B57-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57-ijerph-12-11025">57</a>,
  <a rid="B58-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-ijerph-12-11025">58</a>]. Plentiful rainfall can create an ideally moist environment for rodents and better growth conditions for vegetation that provide a food source, thus leading to an increase in the population size of rodents and contributing to HFRS transmission [
  <a rid="B55-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-12-11025">55</a>,
  <a rid="B59-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-ijerph-12-11025">59</a>,
  <a rid="B60-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60-ijerph-12-11025">60</a>]. Similarly, increased relative humidity can promote rodent reproduction, infectivity and stability of the virus, and thus increase the incidence of HFRS [
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-12-11025">50</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The capacity of China’s current infectious disease control and prevention system to address the daunting challenges of emerging and re-emerging climate-related infectious diseases due to climate change is still under researched and investigated. Research conducted among CDC staff in a Provincial CDC about their perceptions of, and attitudes towards, climate change and infectious diseases, found that CDC health professionals had noticed a climate change-related temporal and spatial change in the transmission patterns of certain infectious diseases such as vector-borne diseases, air-borne diseases and water-borne diseases [
  <a rid="B61-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61-ijerph-12-11025">61</a>,
  <a rid="B62-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-12-11025">62</a>]. Adaptation measures and actions were also proposed, such as strengthening existing disease surveillance systems and vector monitoring; building CDC capacity in terms of infrastructure and in-house health professional training; developing and improving relevant legislation, policies and guidelines; improving coordination among various government departments; engaging the community in infectious disease research and intervention, and conducting collaborative research in infectious diseases with other institutions [
  <a rid="B61-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61-ijerph-12-11025">61</a>,
  <a rid="B62-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-12-11025">62</a>]. However, the two studies were conducted in one province only and similar studies need to be conducted to enhance understanding of the associations between climatic variables and infectious diseases, and to develop appropriate climate change adaptation measures.
