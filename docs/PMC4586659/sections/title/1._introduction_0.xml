 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">China is one of the largest and most populous countries in the world with nearly 20% of the world’s population [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-12-11025">1</a>]. Over the last few decades, China has witnessed an unprecedented economic boom with its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita growing from $193 in 1980 to $6092 in 2012 [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-11025">2</a>]. However, such great economic growth may have been achieved at the cost of the environment and public health programs as compared to other aspects of development including economy, education and technology. One issue is infectious diseases, which continue to impair population health in this populous country [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-12-11025">3</a>]. Although infectious diseases only accounted for about 0.89%–1.06% of all deaths in China in 2011 [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-11025">4</a>], estimates suggest that there are about 7 million cases of notified infectious diseases, such as viral hepatitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, dengue and malaria, occurring amongst the 1.3 billion population, leading to approximately 17,000 deaths each year [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-11025">4</a>,
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-12-11025">5</a>]. Tremendous efforts were made to reduce infectious diseases after 1949 [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-12-11025">6</a>], but some infectious diseases have rebounded and even increased in some areas since the 1980s [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-12-11025">7</a>,
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-11025">8</a>,
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-11025">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-12-11025">10</a>]. Malaria, for example, has been a serious public health problem in China for many years and great efforts have been made to address the problem. Despite a remarkable decline in its incidence from about 2800 per 100,000 in 1970 to 10 per 100,000 in 1990, malaria has re-emerged in some areas since 2001, e.g., Henan, Hubei and Anhui provinces [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, infectious diseases control and prevention had not been given enough attention [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-12-11025">7</a>]. The SARS outbreak started in Guangdong Province in November 2012 and challenged the then Chinese infectious disease control and prevention system. After the SARS outbreak, the Chinese government invested heavily in disease control and prevention [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-11025">12</a>]. As a result, there have been great improvements in public health infrastructure and public health workforce with new laboratories built, a surveillance system upgrade and increases in numbers of public health professionals [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-11025">12</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa in 2014 has drawn worldwide attention [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-11025">14</a>], and accordingly, public health professionals in China have estimated the risk of imported cases and proposed pro-active disease control and prevention actions to minimize the risk of the transmission of the disease to China [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-12-11025">15</a>]. This is partly because China has a close trade relationship with Africa involving a frequent flow of travelers [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-12-11025">16</a>,
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-11025">17</a>,
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-12-11025">18</a>]. Public health authorities have been made aware of the need to continuously strengthen capacity to manage current infectious disease control systems to cope with possible emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases challenges.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">China is an economically, geographically and climatologically diverse country with a huge population which may be the epicenter of new diseases and strains [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-12-11025">19</a>]. However, it remains uncertain how well current disease prevention and management system can sufficiently respond to future challenges of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, which may be exacerbated by the rapid process of urbanization, high numbers of migrant workers, and the impacts from a changing climate. In this light, this paper aims to examine China’s capacity to manage infectious diseases in the future, especially in terms of disease surveillance and the likely impacts of two important issues affecting infectious disease trends—increasing urbanization and climate change.
