 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Until recently, climate change has almost exclusively been framed as an environmental problem [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref020">20</a>]. Correspondingly, the general population is well aware that climate change will harm the environment [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref021">21</a>] and their attitude towards nature and its protection should play some role in accounting for individual differences in mitigating climate change. Previous research confirms that people with strong pro-environmental attitudes are more likely to mitigate climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref023">23</a>]. Given that people who positively evaluate environmental protection usually also hold positive attitudes towards nature in general [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref024">24</a>], we expect the relationship between attitude towards nature and endorsement of mitigation to be positive too.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because adaptation has multiple foci—for example, maintaining human safety—the specific goal of protecting the environment is less prominent for this action than for mitigation [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref002">2</a>]. Indeed, adaptive responses can, sometimes, entail actively changing the environment (e.g., construction of sea dikes to protect inhabited areas from future sea-level rise). We therefore assume that attitude towards nature and attitude towards environmental protection will be positively related to endorsement of adaptation, but not as strongly as these attitudes are related to endorsement of mitigation.
