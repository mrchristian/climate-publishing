 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another important requisite for acting on a threat is the extent to which people feel at risk. Risks can be processed in two different ways: Analytically or affectively. The 
  <span class="italic">analytical</span> processing mode is thought to be slow and deliberative. It deals with abstract symbols and numbers and is used to think about the future or hypothetical events. The 
  <span class="italic">affective</span> processing mode, on the other hand, is fast and does not need any conscious effort. It relies on intuition, experiences, images, and associations [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref025">25</a>]. Importantly, the two processing modes are not independent of each other. They work in parallel and influence our behaviour in conjunction with our decisions [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref026">26</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When used to explain people’s endorsement of 
  <span class="italic">mitigation</span>, both analytic and affective appraisals of risks have been found to be reliable predictors: The more people considered climate change as a risk and the more negative feelings they had about it, the more they were willing to mitigate [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref013">13</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref023">23</a>]. The relevance of risk perceptions for endorsement of 
  <span class="italic">adaptation</span> measures is less clear [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref027">27</a>]. Most studies that investigated risk perceptions explicitly related to climate change found no relevant (or only a negligible) link with people’s level of adaptation support [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref028">28</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref029">29</a>]. This is unexpected, as it conflicts with theoretical work that considers risk perceptions as a crucial factor for people’s motivation to act in response to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref030">30</a>] and is inconsistent with more general research on hazard preparedness, which typically finds that risk perceptions are strongly related to people’s willingness to take preventive measures [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref031">31</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within analytical risk perception another differentiation should be made when dealing with climate change: that of generalised risks (e.g., to other people) versus the risks that are seen to be self-relevant to the individual contemplating action. Typically, people estimate the risks to others to be greater than those to themselves [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref032">32</a>], something that can interfere with taking action because it deflects personal relevance and responsibility. This type of thinking has also been highlighted in relation to the risks of climate change: People generally perceive climate change as a distant threat, something that affects strangers, and that happens in remote times and places rather than here and now [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref033">33</a>]. The perception of climate change as a distant threat could lead to the perspective that climate change risks are irrelevant to the individual and that there is no need for personal action. Put the other way around, when climate change is perceived as a phenomenon with proximal consequences, then people should also have a greater sense of urgency and responsibility, and should ultimately be more motivated to respond to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref034">34</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref036">36</a>]. The assumption that proximal risk perceptions should increase people’s willingness to act seems especially relevant with regard to adaptation, given its predominantly local focus [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref006">6</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref037">37</a>]. Haden and colleagues [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref038">38</a>] provide some empirical evidence for this assumption. They found that the more farmers were concerned about future 
  <span class="italic">local</span> water availability, the more they were willing to adapt to climate change by adopting new irrigation practices.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distinction between proximal and distant risk perceptions also warrants some comments with regard to mitigation. One the one hand, the common assumption that an increased sense of proximal risks motivates people to mitigate [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref034">34</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref035">35</a>] makes intuitive sense. On the other hand, the global scale at which mitigation works [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref004">4</a>] suggests that distant risk perceptions could also be positively linked to endorsement of mitigation, especially among people who are 
  <span class="italic">more</span> concerned about places at a more distant level than they are about proximal places [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref007">7</a>]. Consistent with this reasoning, one study found that the more farmers were concerned about distant climate change, the more they were willing to adopt new mitigation practices [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref038">38</a>]. Thus, there are theoretical reasons for and against the superiority of proximal risk perceptions over distant risk perceptions as a predictor of mitigation support; moreover, some evidence suggests that distant risk perceptions might be more relevant for motivating mitigation than proximal risk perceptions.
