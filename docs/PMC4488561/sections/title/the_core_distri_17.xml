  <a rid="pone.0132326.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132326.g001">Fig 1B</a>). The centroid of future suitable area shifted to the position (112.12E, 33.26N) in the northwest under RCP2.6–2050, to the position (112.33E, 33.46N) under RCP2.6–2070. Under RCP8.5–2050, the centroid of future suitable area was located at a more northwest position (111.51E, 33.83N), and even more northwest at the position (110.64E, 34.18N) under RCP8.5–2070. Overall, we saw the core distributional shift expressed a northwest tendency under both future emission trajectories (RCP2.6, RCP8.5), and a relatively weak strength was found under the emission trajectory of lower representative concentration, RCP2.6 (
