  <span class="italic">orientalis</span>, we performed SDM for current climate conditions using the maximum entropy approach in Maxent v3.3.3 software operating with default settings [
  <a rid="pone.0132326.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132326.ref010">10</a>]. Model predictions were then checked against real observations using the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot [
  <a rid="pone.0132326.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132326.ref021">21</a>]. A ROC curve shows the performance of a model whose output depends on a threshold parameter, it tests whether a model classifies species presence more accurately than random predictions. A perfect model has an AUC of 1, but performance is good when the AUC is &gt; 0.9 [

  <span class="italic">orientalis</span>, we used the “maximum training sensitivity plus specificity” threshold which has been shown to produce highly accurate predictions [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After modeling the current suitable habitat area for

  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> with current climate data, we performed modeling projections for future climate scenarios (RCP2.6–2050, RCP2.6–2070, RCP8.5–2050, and RCP8.5–2070) to predict the future suitable habitat area for the species. The SDM projections were calculated with Maxent software. We cross-checked future suitable habitat areas against the current distribution area of 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> to identify regions that had become (i) unsuitable, (ii) suitable, and (iii) remained unchanged with respect to suitability; we then calculated and illustrated the areas of regions identified in (i)-(iii).
