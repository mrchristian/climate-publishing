  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depth, amount of water received, and shade significantly influenced temperature during the course of treatments (p &lt; 0.001 all cases). Shading had the largest impact (Ƞ
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.566), followed by water treatment (Ƞ
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.441) and depth (Ƞ
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.138). There were significant interactions between depth and shade treatment (p &lt; 0.001) and between depth and water treatment (p &lt; 0.001), but not between shade and water treatment (p = 0.360). The Bonferroni post hoc test showed significant differences in temperature between the control and all water treatments (p &lt; 0.001 in all cases), between low and average treatments (p &lt; 0.01) and between low and high treatments (p = 0.001), but not between average and high treatments (p &gt; 0.05).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When looking at depths separately, the Bonferroni post hoc test showed that there were significant differences in sand temperature at 45cm between control and all water treatments (p &lt; 0.001) and between low and high treatments (p &lt; 0.05), but not between low and average (p = 0.06) and average and high treatments (p = 1.00). During the month of watering, in exposed plots at 45cm, temperatures in the low water treatment were on average 1.8°C lower than the controls, while average and high treatments were 2.3°C and 2.4°C lower, respectively (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between the end of watering and the following month, water content remained the same in the low shaded treatment but decreased in all other plots to 0.021, 0.036, 0.030, 0.049, and 0.033 g g
   <span class="sup">-1</span> in the low exposed, average exposed, average shaded, high exposed, and high shaded plots, respectively. Samples from the control plots could not be collected in the month after water because the upper layers of sand down to 25 cm deep were dry and the hole collapsed. Digging deeper would have mixed the dry sand with the sand below, making it impossible to collect an uncontaminated sample. In month after water application ended, among plots that were shaded, the high water treatment plots still had sand with a water content that was nearly twice that in the plots without water. Among exposed plots, water content was twice as high in the high water treatment plot as in the low water treatment plot one month after water treatments stopped (
