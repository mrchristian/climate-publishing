Bluetongue virus (BTV) is classified among category &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; diseases notifiable to the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE), and is transmitted among ruminants by biting midges of the genus <italic>Culicoides</italic>. Here, we developed a comprehensive occurrence data set to map the current distribution, estimate the ecological niche, and explore the future potential distribution of BTV globally using ecological niche modeling and based on diverse future climate scenarios from general circulation models (GCMs) for four representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The broad ecological niche and potential geographic distribution of BTV under present-day conditions reflected the disease&#x02019;s current distribution across the world in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. All model predictions were significantly better than random expectations. As a further evaluation of model robustness, we compared our model predictions to 331 independent records from most recent outbreaks from the Food and Agriculture Organization Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases Information System (EMPRES-i); all were successfully anticipated by the BTV model. Finally, we tested ecological niche similarity among possible vectors and BTV, and could not reject hypotheses of niche similarity. Under future-climate conditions, the potential distribution of BTV was predicted to broaden, especially in central Africa, United States, and western Russia.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>AMS was supported by the Graduate Fulbright Egyptian Mission Program (EFMP).

Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an arboviral disease in ruminants [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], caused by a member of the genus <italic>Orivirus</italic> in the family <italic>Reoviridae</italic>. The disease is transmitted among ruminants by the bites of biting midges of the genus <italic>Culicoides</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>BTV has been responsible for massive sheep mortality; for example, outbreaks in the Mediterranean region since 1998 resulted in deaths of over 800,000 sheep [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A single strain of BTV in Belgium disrupted animal trade and killed animals with a market value of UK &#x000a3;180 million during a 2006&#x02013;2007 outbreak [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the United States, BTV causes losses of US $125 million yearly [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previous reports have discussed early introduction of infected sheep into South Africa 125 years ago [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but others identified South Africa as the origin of the infection [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>BTV geography was long limited to a range between 40&#x000b0;N and 35&#x000b0;S [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recently, however, several BTV strains began to spread worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], including to more northern parts of Europe, in 1998 [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The expansion and the potential for susceptibility of new vector species to the virus raises concerns of broader BTV spread [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. BTV is transmitted by several vector species: <italic>Culicoides imicola</italic> Kieffer, 1913 (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) is the most significant vector in the Old World [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but three other species serve as vectors in the United Sates alone [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The distribution and movement of hosts has also been identified as a limiting factor for BTV spread; although BTV is known to have infected several ruminants, cattle and sheep are identified as primary reservoirs in several endemic areas worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The combination of climate, presence of susceptible host, and presence of competent vectors marks areas where BTV can circulate in the long term among livestock.</p><p>Previous studies have mapped BTV risk based on occurrence data from single countries [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; others included vector distributions in mapping efforts [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Ecological niche models provide a robust approach by which to assess and evaluate distribution of disease risk [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]: this approach has been used in mapping everything from fungal to arboviral diseases in several recent analyses [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Here, we developed a comprehensive database of BTV case occurrences, and estimated the global potential distribution of BTV under both current and future climate conditions. The study used outputs from 62 general climate models (GCMs) and four representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios from the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to estimate the future potential distribution of the virus. Finally, we tested niche similarity between several vector species and BTV case distribution in different geographic areas to provide some level of assessment of the role of particular potential vector species in BTV transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Input data</title><p>Primary records of BTV occurrences (i.e. data reports of animal infections) were obtained from the PubMed database and Web of Knowledge using the search term &#x0201c;bluetongue virus&#x0201d;, as well as from OIE reports (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oie.int">www.oie.int</ext-link>), the ReoID database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reoviridae.org/">www.reoviridae.org/</ext-link>), and the Food and Agriculture Organization Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases Information System (EMPRES-i; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://empres-i.fao.org">http://empres-i.fao.org</ext-link>). Data regarding BTV occurrences through November 2014 were used in calibration, whereas occurrences from after that date (through September 2015) were used to provide a semi-independent data set for model evaluation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Discussion</xref>). BTV records were drawn from diverse sources as we are seeking a global map of disease across the world; however, OIE and FAO data are limited to countries where BTV is notifiable, with most sampling in Europe and United States; data did not include the older BTV outbreaks in Africa and Asia. For niche comparisons with possible vectors, we collected vector occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org">www.gbif.org</ext-link>) and literature in the PubMed and Web of Knowledge databases. The vector occurrences included records for six species: <italic>C</italic>. <italic>imicola</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>insignis</italic> Lutz, 1913, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>variipennis</italic> Coquillett, 1901, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sonorensis</italic> Wirth &#x00026; Jones, 1957, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>occidentalis</italic> Wirth &#x00026; Jones, 1957, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>brevitarsis</italic> Kieffer, 1917. When geographic references were textual, we assigned geographic coordinates based on consultation of online gazetteer data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gpsvisualizer.com">www.gpsvisualizer.com</ext-link>). Data were filtered to eliminate duplicate records; we further reduced the data such that no pair of points was separated by &#x0003c;20 km (i.e., a single pixel) to reduce biases in calibrating ENMs [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The final occurrence data set was divided in two equal portions: half to calibrate the model, and half for evaluating model predictions.</p><p>To characterize current global climates, we used data available from the WorldClim archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org">www.worldclim.org</ext-link>), which comprise19 bioclimatic variables derived from monthly temperature and rainfall values collected during 1950&#x02013;2000 [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We used the 10&#x002c8; spatial resolution in light of the global extent of our modeling efforts. For future conditions, we obtained data based on GCM outputs for 2050. These data comprised four RCPs spanning broadly different emissions scenarios into the future. Our future-climate projections thus summarized 62 combinations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150489.s001">S1 File</xref>). We used bioclimatic variables derived from monthly temperature and precipitation values because they are known factors in BTV transmission risk [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>We omitted bioclimatic variables 8&#x02013;9 and 18&#x02013;19 from analysis, in light of known spatial artifacts in those four variables. The remaining of 15 variables were subjected to a principal components analysis (PCAs) to reduce the dimensionality of our models and avoid multicollinearity of variables (see summary of variable correlations in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150489.s002">S2 File</xref>). The component loadings in the present-day data were used to transform future-climate data, using the ENMGadgets package [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in R version 3.2.0 [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Ecological niche modeling</title><p>The maximum entropy algorithm implemented in Maxent version 3.3 [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] was used to estimate the ecological niche of BTV, roughly defined as the set of environmental conditions under which the species can maintain populations [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

We used the bootstrap functionality in Maxent to produce 100 replicate analyses. We used the median values across all models and replicates as a best estimate of the ecological niche of BTV. Finally, we calculated the median of the medians across all GCMs within each RCP scenario. Final models were thresholded based on a minimum allowable omission error rate of 5% (<italic>E</italic> = 5%; [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]), assuming that a minimum of 5% of occurrences data may have errors in geolocation that misrepresented environmental values.

A further evaluation of our model was based on independent data from recent outbreaks reported to FAO EMPRES-i. These data represent outbreaks reported between December 2014 and September 2015; that is, the evaluation data come from the year following the temporal span of the data used for model calibration.

We used these data to map the potential distribution of BTV in the present-day, and also to identify future potential distributional shifts in view of the most recent future climate scenario model outputs. The availability of BTV data was poor until large-scale outbreaks across Europe began in the late 1990s; since then, the disease has caused serious impacts on international animal trade, and serious illness and high mortality rates among ruminants [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and reporting has been more detailed.</p><p>Climate has been suggested as a major driver of the distribution of BTV [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; for example, the European outbreaks were thought to be a consequence of warming climates [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and the virus expanded another ~800 north in 2005 [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Historically, the disease was found in a belt between 40&#x000b0;N and 35&#x000b0;S that included northern Australia, parts of the Indian Subcontinent, Middle East, Africa, Cyprus, and the Americas. Prior to that point, BTV was known only from South Africa and Cyprus [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], The origin of the disease thus has three possible explanations: (1) BTV was present in both Africa and Europe but was not documented owing to misidentification or poor diagnostic tools; (2) BTV originated in South Africa and dispersed to Europe; (3) BTV originated in Europe and dispersed to South Africa. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that strains responsible for the new BTV outbreaks are similar to those that circulated for decades in early epidemic sites [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. FAOSTAT data indicate results revealed continuous international trade between Europe and Africa [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which could allow viral infections in animals to move between the two continents. This observation also suggests that the virus will be able to spread to new sites that become suitable as climatic conditions change in coming decades.</p><p>We modelled BTV occurrences using the most recent version of 62 future climate model outputs, and used four RCPs to summarize variations among possible greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. Our results indicated the possibility of range expansion to other regions where the virus is not presently endemic, in response to climate changes [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies predicted the distribution of BTV and its vectors; most of these studies were limited to Europe after BTV emergence in Europe [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and assessed transmission risk based mostly on vector distribution and abundance [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, a single study took the advantage of a mechanistic models to quantify <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> values of BTV across Europe based on different temporal scales of climate data. This latter study demonstrated BTV risk areas across most of Europe that coincide with our results. However, our prediction covers a much broader portion of Europe, extending across much of the continent, east to western Russia. A recent study of BTV potential in the United States predicted that further northwards expansion of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sonorensis</italic> can be expected in the future [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our current study anticipated both the northern United States, southwestern Canada, and Ontario as at risk, as long as both BTV and vector expand distributionally in tandem; however, it marked unsuitability of conditions to virus spread along the US Gulf Coast and in the eastern Rocky Mountains, where livestock and wild animals have been diagnosed as positive to BTV [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This discord may reflect limitations of our model; however, these same regions were identified as suitable in our future models, which may indicate that our present-day models cannot anticipate risk in these regions given ongoing climate reorganization.</p><p>The models estimated in our study showed significant performance in two tests based on testing data that are ostensibly independent from the data used in model calibration. However, we see some room for concern about this level of independence because disease events are dependent events on a number of levels&#x02014;individual cases may be linked to one another via pathogen and vector population biology, on both micro and macro scales. Similarly, surveillance is often responsive, and gets concentrated in affected areas, which can create additional dependencies. For these reasons, our data set was selected to constitute different data sources that represent sampling across the world and not just notified data from EMPRES-i. Our evaluation tested the possibility of these models to predict the recent outbreaks across the world from December 2014 until the most recent outbreak in Ontario, Canada. These models could anticipate all of these current outbreaks.</p><p>Different levels of uncertainty were associated with the mapping process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150489.s006">S6 File</xref>). These uncertainty estimates were based on variations in predicted distributions of BTV across different climate models rather than just an estimate of internal uncertainty for predictions under the same climate model [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Finally, our models offered an interesting perspective on vector associations of BTV infections around the world. The BTV transmission cycle includes hosting by ruminants and vectors that transmit virus between hosts. Major knowledge gaps include the broader host distribution of BTV in diverse livestock hosts, and the vanishingly few studies that have focused on vector competence of different species of <italic>Culicoides</italic>. This study characterized diversity in the species of vectors associated with BTV in different parts of the world: <italic>C</italic>. <italic>imicola</italic> in the Old World, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sonorensis</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>variipennis</italic> in North America, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>insignis</italic> in North and South America, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>occidentalis</italic> in southern United States and Central America, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>brevitarsis</italic> in Australia. We tested niche similarity between each vector and BTV distribution across the accessible region for the corresponding vector; we could not reject the null hypothesis in any case, so vector populations and BTV appear to share similar ecological niches. This observation is important because (1) vector populations can assist in identifying the potential distribution of the BTV in countries where the disease is not reported dependably to authorities, and (2) vector populations may drive BTV response to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0150489.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The current study leaves important questions unanswered regarding the global distribution of BTV: one related to the relationship between vector population dynamics and changes in BTV transmission, host response to climate change, and responses of different BTV serotypes to climate and how much these responses are similar or different. Our future work will focus on exploring these questions to illuminate additional key details of BTV epidemiology and ecology around the world.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec009"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150489.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>A summary of four representative concentration pathways and 62 climate models used in BTV model projection in future climate conditions.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150489.s001.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150489.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Correlation matrix showing patterns of relationships among environmental variables used in model calibration.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150489.s002.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150489.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Summary of BTV vector occurrences available for testing niche similarity between BTV and vector niches and based on accessible area (M).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150489.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150489.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Range of BTV expansion based on presence-absence matrix of each ecological niche model for corresponding climate model.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150489.s004.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150489.s005"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Results of background similarity tests assessing niche similarity between bluetongue virus and six vector species.</title><p>The null hypothesis of niche similarity was rejected if the observed D or I values for the BTV and vector species in question fell below the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile in the random-replicate distribution (i.e. 5% in table).</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150489.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150489.s006"><label>S6 File</label><caption><title>Uncertainty estimates associated with BTV mapping process in different climate models within each representative concentration pathway.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150489.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>AMS was funded by the Graduate Egyptian Fulbright Mission Program (EFMP).
