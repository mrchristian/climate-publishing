  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Primary records of BTV occurrences (i.e. data reports of animal infections) were obtained from the PubMed database and Web of Knowledge using the search term “bluetongue virus”, as well as from OIE reports (

Data regarding BTV occurrences through November 2014 were used in calibration, whereas occurrences from after that date (through September 2015) were used to provide a semi-independent data set for model evaluation (see 
   <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec008" href="#sec008">Discussion</a>). BTV records were drawn from diverse sources as we are seeking a global map of disease across the world; however, OIE and FAO data are limited to countries where BTV is notifiable, with most sampling in Europe and United States; data did not include the older BTV outbreaks in Africa and Asia. For niche comparisons with possible vectors, we collected vector occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.gbif.org</span>) and literature in the PubMed and Web of Knowledge databases. The vector occurrences included records for six species:

Data were filtered to eliminate duplicate records; we further reduced the data such that no pair of points was separated by &lt;20 km (i.e., a single pixel) to reduce biases in calibrating ENMs [
   <a rid="pone.0150489.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref023">23</a>]. The final occurrence data set was divided in two equal portions: half to calibrate the model, and half for evaluating model predictions.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To characterize current global climates, we used data available from the WorldClim archive (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.worldclim.org</span>), which comprise19 bioclimatic variables derived from monthly temperature and rainfall values collected during 1950–2000 [
   <a rid="pone.0150489.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref024">24</a>]. We used the 10ˈ spatial resolution in light of the global extent of our modeling efforts. For future conditions, we obtained data based on GCM outputs for 2050. These data comprised four RCPs spanning broadly different emissions scenarios into the future. Our future-climate projections thus summarized 62 combinations (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150489.s001" href="#pone.0150489.s001">S1 File</a>). We used bioclimatic variables derived from monthly temperature and precipitation values because they are known factors in BTV transmission risk [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We omitted bioclimatic variables 8–9 and 18–19 from analysis, in light of known spatial artifacts in those four variables. The remaining of 15 variables were subjected to a principal components analysis (PCAs) to reduce the dimensionality of our models and avoid multicollinearity of variables (see summary of variable correlations in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150489.s002" href="#pone.0150489.s002">S2 File</a>). The component loadings in the present-day data were used to transform future-climate data, using the ENMGadgets package [

   <a rid="pone.0150489.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref031">31</a>] considering the geographic distribution of recent BTV outbreaks, which have been very broad, covering much of the world. We used the bootstrap functionality in Maxent to produce 100 replicate analyses. We used the median values across all models and replicates as a best estimate of the ecological niche of BTV. Finally, we calculated the median of the medians across all GCMs within each RCP scenario. Final models were thresholded based on a minimum allowable omission error rate of 5% (

   <a rid="pone.0150489.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref032">32</a>]), assuming that a minimum of 5% of occurrences data may have errors in geolocation that misrepresented environmental values. We used the range (maximum–minimum) as an index of uncertainty between diverse models within each RCP.

A further evaluation of our model was based on independent data from recent outbreaks reported to FAO EMPRES-i. These data represent outbreaks reported between December 2014 and September 2015; that is, the evaluation data come from the year following the temporal span of the data used for model calibration. We used a one-tailed cumulative binomial probability distribution that assessed the probability of obtaining the observed level of correct prediction by a chance alone, given the background expectation of correct predictions based on the proportional coverage of the region by the thresholded model prediction.
