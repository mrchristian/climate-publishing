 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study built a comprehensive database of BTV occurrences from 1964 through November 2014. We used these data to map the potential distribution of BTV in the present-day, and also to identify future potential distributional shifts in view of the most recent future climate scenario model outputs. The availability of BTV data was poor until large-scale outbreaks across Europe began in the late 1990s; since then, the disease has caused serious impacts on international animal trade, and serious illness and high mortality rates among ruminants [

  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref039">39</a>], and reporting has been more detailed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate has been suggested as a major driver of the distribution of BTV [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref001">1</a>]; for example, the European outbreaks were thought to be a consequence of warming climates [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref001">1</a>], and the virus expanded another ~800 north in 2005 [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref040">40</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref041">41</a>]. Historically, the disease was found in a belt between 40°N and 35°S that included northern Australia, parts of the Indian Subcontinent, Middle East, Africa, Cyprus, and the Americas. Prior to that point, BTV was known only from South Africa and Cyprus [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref008">8</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref042">42</a>], The origin of the disease thus has three possible explanations: (1) BTV was present in both Africa and Europe but was not documented owing to misidentification or poor diagnostic tools; (2) BTV originated in South Africa and dispersed to Europe; (3) BTV originated in Europe and dispersed to South Africa. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that strains responsible for the new BTV outbreaks are similar to those that circulated for decades in early epidemic sites [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref001">1</a>]. FAOSTAT data indicate results revealed continuous international trade between Europe and Africa [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref043">43</a>], which could allow viral infections in animals to move between the two continents. This observation also suggests that the virus will be able to spread to new sites that become suitable as climatic conditions change in coming decades.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We modelled BTV occurrences using the most recent version of 62 future climate model outputs, and used four RCPs to summarize variations among possible greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. Our results indicated the possibility of range expansion to other regions where the virus is not presently endemic, in response to climate changes [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref001">1</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies predicted the distribution of BTV and its vectors; most of these studies were limited to Europe after BTV emergence in Europe [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref018">18</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref026">26</a>], and assessed transmission risk based mostly on vector distribution and abundance [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref018">18</a>]. However, a single study took the advantage of a mechanistic models to quantify 
  <span class="italic">R</span>

  </sub> values of BTV across Europe based on different temporal scales of climate data. This latter study demonstrated BTV risk areas across most of Europe that coincide with our results. However, our prediction covers a much broader portion of Europe, extending across much of the continent, east to western Russia. A recent study of BTV potential in the United States predicted that further northwards expansion of 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sonorensis</span> can be expected in the future [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref044">44</a>]. Our current study anticipated both the northern United States, southwestern Canada, and Ontario as at risk, as long as both BTV and vector expand distributionally in tandem; however, it marked unsuitability of conditions to virus spread along the US Gulf Coast and in the eastern Rocky Mountains, where livestock and wild animals have been diagnosed as positive to BTV [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref010">10</a>]. This discord may reflect limitations of our model; however, these same regions were identified as suitable in our future models, which may indicate that our present-day models cannot anticipate risk in these regions given ongoing climate reorganization.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The models estimated in our study showed significant performance in two tests based on testing data that are ostensibly independent from the data used in model calibration. However, we see some room for concern about this level of independence because disease events are dependent events on a number of levels—individual cases may be linked to one another via pathogen and vector population biology, on both micro and macro scales. Similarly, surveillance is often responsive, and gets concentrated in affected areas, which can create additional dependencies. For these reasons, our data set was selected to constitute different data sources that represent sampling across the world and not just notified data from EMPRES-i. Our evaluation tested the possibility of these models to predict the recent outbreaks across the world from December 2014 until the most recent outbreak in Ontario, Canada. These models could anticipate all of these current outbreaks.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Different levels of uncertainty were associated with the mapping process (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150489.s006" href="#pone.0150489.s006">S6 File</a>). These uncertainty estimates were based on variations in predicted distributions of BTV across different climate models rather than just an estimate of internal uncertainty for predictions under the same climate model [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref022">22</a>,

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, our models offered an interesting perspective on vector associations of BTV infections around the world. The BTV transmission cycle includes hosting by ruminants and vectors that transmit virus between hosts. Major knowledge gaps include the broader host distribution of BTV in diverse livestock hosts, and the vanishingly few studies that have focused on vector competence of different species of 
  <span class="italic">Culicoides</span>. This study characterized diversity in the species of vectors associated with BTV in different parts of the world: 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">imicola</span> in the Old World, 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sonorensis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">variipennis</span> in North America, 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">insignis</span> in North and South America, 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">occidentalis</span> in southern United States and Central America, and 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">brevitarsis</span> in Australia. We tested niche similarity between each vector and BTV distribution across the accessible region for the corresponding vector; we could not reject the null hypothesis in any case, so vector populations and BTV appear to share similar ecological niches. This observation is important because (1) vector populations can assist in identifying the potential distribution of the BTV in countries where the disease is not reported dependably to authorities, and (2) vector populations may drive BTV response to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref046">46</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current study leaves important questions unanswered regarding the global distribution of BTV: one related to the relationship between vector population dynamics and changes in BTV transmission, host response to climate change, and responses of different BTV serotypes to climate and how much these responses are similar or different. Our future work will focus on exploring these questions to illuminate additional key details of BTV epidemiology and ecology around the world.</p>
