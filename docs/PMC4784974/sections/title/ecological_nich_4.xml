  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref029">29</a>] was used to estimate the ecological niche of BTV, roughly defined as the set of environmental conditions under which the species can maintain populations [

  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref031">31</a>] considering the geographic distribution of recent BTV outbreaks, which have been very broad, covering much of the world. We used the bootstrap functionality in Maxent to produce 100 replicate analyses. We used the median values across all models and replicates as a best estimate of the ecological niche of BTV. Finally, we calculated the median of the medians across all GCMs within each RCP scenario. Final models were thresholded based on a minimum allowable omission error rate of 5% (

  <a rid="pone.0150489.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150489.ref032">32</a>]), assuming that a minimum of 5% of occurrences data may have errors in geolocation that misrepresented environmental values. We used the range (maximumâ€“minimum) as an index of uncertainty between diverse models within each RCP.
