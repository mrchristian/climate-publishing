 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mercury found in the Arctic is a result of worldwide human activities and natural processes. Production and consumption of energy and industrial goods, increasing human population and their related activities and demands are the main drivers of environmental change, and affect mercury concentrations in the Arctic and Europe at present and will continue to do so in the future. Emission inventory results presented in the 2013 global mercury assessment prepared by UNEP and AMAP have identified artisanal and small- scale gold mining as the major anthropogenic sources of global mercury emissions to the atmosphere in 2010, followed by combustion of fossil fuels (mainly coal) for energy and heat production in power plants and for industrial and residential purposes [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-03579">8</a>]. These sources account for more than half of the anthropogenic mercury emissions globally, estimated to about 1960 tonnes annually, within the uncertainty range of 1010â€“4070 tonnes. Other significant industrial sources of global mercury emissions to the atmosphere are primary non-ferrous metals production, cement production, large-scale gold production and waste from consumer products (mostly landfill but also incineration), pig iron production, chlor-alkali industry, mercury production, oil refining and dental amalgam through human cremation [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mercury used for artisanal gold mining, and mercury present as impurity in various fuels and ores, as well as in limestone and other raw materials in cement manufacture, are the key parameters affecting the amount of atmospheric emissions of mercury from the above mentioned sources [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-03579">8</a>]. Details on the impact of various factors on the magnitude of emissions are presented in the literature [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-03579">9</a>]. Although the total anthropogenic mercury emissions to the atmosphere appeared to be relatively stable between 1990 and 2010 [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-03579">8</a>,
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-12-03579">10</a>], a decrease in emissions in Europe and North America during the time period has been offset by an increase in Asia. In general, the largest increase in emissions is due to an increase in coal combustion for power and heat generation and for industrial purposes. Increased use of air pollution controls, removing mercury as a co-benefit in combination with some mercury specific removing technologies, has slowed down or even reduced the emissions from the increased energy demand. This is the case for Europe and North America, but is also becoming apparent from new coal-fired power plants with state-of-art pollution controls recently installed in China [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mercury emitted naturally from volcano eruptions, geothermal sources, topsoil and re-emission of the contaminant from aquatic and terrestrial surfaces adds large amounts to the global mercury balance. Re-emitted mercury originates from both natural and anthropogenic sources cycling between air, land, and water; however, anthropogenic sources are the main contributor to the environmental burden of mercury, causing higher levels of re-emissions. Over the years, several estimates have been presented in the scientific literature on the annual magnitude of such natural and re-emitted anthropogenic emissions, ranging from 3600 tonnes per year [
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-12-03579">11</a>] to 5300 tonnes [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-03579">12</a>]. Other studies include estimates of 4200 tonnes [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-03579">13</a>], 4278 tonnes [
