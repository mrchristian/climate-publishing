 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The world is experiencing a triple crisis of chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), economic and geopolitical instability and climatic volatility. The magnitude of these crises is unprecedented with both climate change [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-12-12941">1</a>] and NCDs [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-12941">2</a>] described as among the 21st Century’s most daunting challenges.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The world awoke slowly to the threat of climate change, defined as “…a change in the state of the climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer” [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-12-12941">3</a>]. There is now a compelling body of literature on this phenomenon which we will not report on here. Suffice to say that the strength of the evidence is such that the UN; governments; corporate, church, academic and global health leaders now accept the reality of climate change, and are increasingly aware of its potentially dire consequences for human health and development.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, the threat of NCDs was not well-perceived until the major NCDs—cardiovascular disease; diabetes; cancer; and chronic respiratory diseases—already accounted for &gt;60% of the world’s annual deaths [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-12941">4</a>] and by 2030 the toll will rise to 75% of global deaths [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-12-12941">5</a>]. The morbidity, mortality, health system and societal implications of this are well documented elsewhere, for example there have been four Lancet Series on NCDs since 2005 [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-12-12941">6</a>,
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-12-12941">7</a>,
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-12941">8</a>,
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-12941">9</a>]. The macro-economic consequences of NCD-related illness and disability from absenteeism, early retirement, and premature death foster national and global economic uncertainty and limit economic growth [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-12941">4</a>,
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-12-12941">5</a>,
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-12-12941">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-12-12941">11</a>] and, thus, hinders poverty alleviation and human development. This burden disproportionately affects developing countries which have the least capacity to respond. Likewise with climate change, 99% of the projected associated health burden will be borne by the developing world despite it generating only 3% of carbon emissions [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-12941">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The magnitude of the global impact of NCDs is such that, in 2011, The UN General Assembly held its second only special meeting dedicated to a specific disease area on NCDs—the first being on HIV/AIDS 10 years earlier. The UN High Level Meeting on NCDs resulted in a Political Declaration [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-12941">13</a>] which called for action on NCDs and noted issues such as unhealthy urbanization and unhealthy diets as contributing factors to their rapid escalation. Shortly thereafter, the UN Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development published its Outcomes Document, 
  <span class="italic">The Future We Want</span> [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-12941">2</a>] which recognizes health as: “
  <span class="italic">a precondition for and an outcome and indicator of all three dimensions of sustainable development….</span>” the three dimensions being environmental, social and economic. The Rio+20 Outcomes Document also specifically cites NCDs as a threat to sustainable development.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given this it is surprising that the links between climate change and NCDs has received relatively little attention to date. However, there is a sizeable and growing literature on climate change and health more broadly. For example, the notion of ‘one planet-one health’ holds that human, animal, and planetary health are so inextricably interlinked that the well-being of each is dependent on the well-being of the other [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-12941">14</a>,
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-12-12941">15</a>]. Two Lancet series [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-12-12941">16</a>,
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-12941">17</a>] outline a litany of climate change impacts on health from heat stress, floods, droughts and storms, as well as less direct impacts such as changing infectious disease patterns, food insecurity, and air pollution. Interestingly there is also emerging evidence of links between NCDs and some of the major infectious diseases [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-12-12941">18</a>]. While the Lancet series includes some discussion of NCDs, the WHO’s quantitative risk assessment of the effect of climate change on selected mortality [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-12-12941">19</a>] focusses on heat- and flood- related mortality, diarrheal diseases, under-nutrition, malaria and Dengue.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">NCDs are not as obviously associated with climate change as are fires, floods, famines, changes in the distribution of existing infectious diseases and the emergence of new microbial infections. But, on closer examination, increases in obesity and other risks for NCDs over recent decades have much in common with the causes of environmental degradation. Genes and ageing aside, the major NCDs share four common, modifiable risks, 
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, inappropriate diets (under- or over-nutrition), physical inactivity, tobacco use, and alcohol misuse. While the last two of these are largely socially mediated, the first two are closely linked to causes of climate change. This is not to say that climate change and NCDs cause each other, although in some instances there may be causal interactions. Rather, we, and others, argue that NCDs and climate change share common vectors and strong associations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, the way and what we eat, how we work predominantly in cities at sedentary tasks, and transport ourselves with little physical effort, not only damages our health but also harms the planet. Some common vectors of NCDs and climate change are seen in links between greenhouse gas emissions and body mass index [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-12-12941">20</a>]; car travel, obesity and air pollution [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-12-12941">21</a>], sitting for long periods and increased risk of mortality [
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-12-12941">22</a>]. There are also reports that soil degradation resulting from mass food production and poor land management is depleting the micro-nutrient content of fruit and vegetables [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-12941">23</a>,
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-12-12941">24</a>,
  <a rid="B25-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-12-12941">25</a>] thus further undermining human and animal nutrition and, therefore, health. A more direct link between climate change and NCDs is the increased incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses caused by air pollution—air pollution being both 
  <span class="italic">caused by</span> and a 
  <span class="italic">cause of</span> climate change [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-12941">17</a>]. For example, air pollution from bush fires could be said to be caused by climate change, but air pollution from vehicle emissions is a contributing factor to climate change as well as a cause of chronic respiratory disease [
  <a rid="B26-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-12-12941">26</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite a substantial body of frameworks to guide research, action and policy on 
  <span class="italic">health</span> and climate change [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-12941">17</a>,

  <a rid="B34-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-12-12941">34</a>] there is little evidence about the effectiveness of interventions aimed at redressing their adverse interactions. Notwithstanding research priorities [
  <a rid="B35-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-12-12941">35</a>] and priority actions [
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-12-12941">36</a>] for NCDs alone, there is even less evidence specifically about the interaction between 
  <span class="italic">NCDs</span> and climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The available literature on health and climate change is largely confined to “issues-raising” expert opinion and commentary; estimates and modelling; and reviews of non-empirical work and the “grey literature”. Such contributions are clearly important [
  <a rid="B31-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-12-12941">31</a>] but have not yet translated into comprehensive systematic, evidence-generating enquiry and there has been little emphasis on combining legal and public health thinking and solutions at the interface between NCDs and climate change [
  <a rid="B37-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-12-12941">37</a>]. Nor have the “health in all policies” [
  <a rid="B38-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-12-12941">38</a>] and health impact assessment [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-12-12941">39</a>] movements yet successfully bridged this divide or integrated with environment impact theory and practice, although this may be imminent [
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-12-12941">40</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As pointed out by Haines and McMichael [
  <a rid="B41-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-12-12941">41</a>], the clear definition of precisely what needs to be researched is hindered by uncertainties about the exact nature and rate of climate change and the sheer magnitude and complexity of the systems, sectors and politics involved. McMichael also detailed the challenge elsewhere [
  <a rid="B31-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-12-12941">31</a>,
  <a rid="B42-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-12-12941">42</a>], especially the need for new research methods and models and the imperative to stop applying old thinking and tools to new and unchartered problems. To deal effectively with complex issues, Finegood 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B43-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-12-12941">43</a>] advised that “
  <span class="italic">…we need to move from an analysis of the determinants or causes of the problem to a solution orientation; the frameworks used to describe the problem may not be the right ones for building the "best" solutions</span>”.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To contribute to knowledge and understanding of the problem and attempt to move closer to a solution orientation, we used qualitative research to take a further step towards identifying priority research and action areas at the interface between NCDs and climate change, particularly those areas that might be amenable to mitigation via legal interventions. We began by anchoring the process to an existing advocacy framework which had previously been endorsed by a consensus of 100 international experts who attended the Oxford Health Alliance’s 2008 Summit in Sydney, Australia (see the Sydney Resolution at 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ijerph-12-12941-s001" href="#ijerph-12-12941-s001">Figure S1</a>) which called for healthy food, physical activity, work, business and policy environments. By systematically obtaining expert opinion from a range of disciplines, sectors and settings we identified a set of priority areas and questions which have potential to assist solutions-oriented, evidence-generating research to inform policy, planning and funding decisions.
