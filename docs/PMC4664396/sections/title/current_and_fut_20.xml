 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The maximum entropy niche modeling procedure was adopted here to understand 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span> distributions in India under present conditions and three climate change scenarios and to identify the areas most vulnerable to invasion under changed climate. The models show high AUC values (&gt;0.94 for both test and training data) indicating that models successfully predict species distribution with a high degree of accuracy. An earlier work by Sridhar et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref071">71</a>] using CLIMEX model to predict 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span> invasion under current climate scenario used much coarser grid (0.5Â° degrees) than the present study (30 arc seconds). This study showed that much of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, the warmer and drier regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat and some parts of North Eastern states are less vulnerable to invasion, which is also shown in our study. Apart from these states, most parts of India are highly prone to invasion [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref069">69</a>]. However, contrary to this, our study being at much finer scale emphasizes that not all parts of each state are equally vulnerable to invasion. Another study at a much smaller scale using maximum entropy modeling has predicted an increased infestation of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span> in Kerala [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref072">72</a>]. However, our results suggest that there is no significant difference between invasion risks in Kerala under current and all three future climate change scenarios.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not all invasive species respond to climate change in a similar way. For example, some invasive species are likely to be reduced in range due to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref073">73</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref074">74</a>]. The studies have suggested that American bullfrog and Burmese python will have reduced invasion potential under climate change scenarios [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref074">74</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref075">75</a>]. A recent study on Argentine ant invasions at global level have predicted reduced invasive potential, but there is potential for some regional expansions [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref076">76</a>]. On the contrary, increase in temperature expands range for some other invasive species like 
  <span class="italic">Chromolaena odorata</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Lantana camara</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref051">51</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref077">77</a>]. In the Indian scenario, studies speculate that change in climate will increase wetness and precipitation [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref078">78</a>], especially in the southern Western Ghats and some species will undergo shifts in their range in future [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref079">79</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref080">80</a>]. The MaxEnt model results suggests that the climate change (under RCP 6.0) is likely to increase land area at risk of invasion by up to 1.04%. Currently less suitable regions might become more suitable and vice-versa under changed climate, especially in peninsular India, and eastern India.
