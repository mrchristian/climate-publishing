  <span class="italic">fulica</span>. These policies should be based on sound science that takes into account interactions between the species, climate change, land use changes and livelihood aspects of the communities in the invaded landscape [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref093">93</a>]. Since, the snail is a major pest on agricultural and horticultural crops, it is imperative to consider livelihood while framing the policies. In particular, small farmers are highly vulnerable to both invasive species as well as climate change. Hence, the cost of invasion on agriculture and horticulture needs to be studied.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecological niche modeling is a cost-effective, easy and early warning system that allows the identification of areas at risk from a potential invasion, thus giving the opportunity to prioritize the region and target management actions as well as investment of resources in those certain regions. There is an urgency to set up long-term monitoring studies on 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span> populations to understand the invasion patterns, its impact on native species and economy that will allow better understanding for future management of this highly invasive land snail. In order to control the spread of the existing 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span> populations, and to prevent further invasions in India, we consider that the results of this study should be taken into account when identifying vulnerable areas and making management decisions for control of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span> in India.
