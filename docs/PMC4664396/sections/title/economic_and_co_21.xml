  <span class="italic">Dreissena polymorpha</span> (zebra mussel) invasion in the United States was estimated to be US$ 3.1 billion between 1993–1999 for power plants and over US$ 5 billion when other sectors are considered [

  <span class="italic">fulica</span> in India is a major problem, not only in semi-urban or peri-urban areas but also increasingly in rural areas. Agriculture, particularly in India with nearly 60% being rain-fed, has been a highly risky venture with extremities in monsoon coupled with other abiotic and biotic factors. Climate change is set to compound the daunting complex challenges already being faced by the farmers. Increasing temperature will have significant negative impact on crop yield [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref084">84</a>]. This along with land use and invasive species such as 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span> will have even more impact on small-scale agriculture and horticulture. The invasion is particularly high during monsoon months (June to November) when most of the small-scale farmers grow vegetables and horticultural crops. We have found here that regions with high agriculture output in India also have high invasion risk. These regions include Kerala, coastal parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Assam [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref085">85</a>]. The slow growth regions in terms of agriculture such as Bihar and parts of Uttar Pradesh are also very economically backward regions and highly dependent on monsoon for good yield. These regions are also highly vulnerable to invasion. Increased invasion by

  <span class="italic">fulica</span> under future climate in these regions will only worsen the agriculture situation in India, thus further marginalizing the small-farming community and adversely impacting local economies.

  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref087">87</a>], there is urgent need to study the impact on native biodiversity.
