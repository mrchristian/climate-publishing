 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We applied (
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="EEq2" href="#EEq2">2</a>) to gridded temperature and precipitation datasets for the baseline climate and future climate to compute 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> for each pixel in a GIS. The datasets used covered the entire continent of Africa. Data on mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation for the baseline climate (i.e., average values for the period from 1950 to 2000) were downloaded from the WorldClim database as raster grids with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds (approximately 1 km at the equator) [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">15</a>]. For the future climate, we used temperature and precipitation projections of the HadCM3 and CSIRO Mk3 general circulation models (GCM) based on the A2a emission scenario. Data for the future climate (average values for 2020–2039, hereafter 2040) were downloaded from the Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) database in raster format at the same spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">16</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> was calculated separately for the baseline climate and for each GCM model.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine whether falciparum malaria will persist or the disease dies out in the future, we evaluated the following boolean expressions on a pixel basis, respectively: 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1 for the baseline map and 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1 for the future map; 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1 for the baseline map and 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1 for the future map.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This allowed us to classify an area as becoming malaria endemic or malaria-free. All the maps generated in this study are based on the Albers equal-area conic projection. We clipped the 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> maps by the raster maps of the digital map of dominant vectors to exclude malaria-free areas such as the Sahara Desert (indicate source here). We used ArcGIS 10.1 for all GIS analysis.
