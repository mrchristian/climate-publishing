 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A solid majority of respondents are convinced that human-caused climate change is occurring. Over 97% of respondents indicated that climate change is happening (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-11-12473-f001" href="#ijerph-11-12473-f001">Figure 1</a>), and 62% said that it is mostly or entirely caused by human activity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nearly all survey respondents reported that climate change is relevant to direct patient care (88%) (A great deal 24%, A moderate amount 42%, Only a little 22%), suggesting they think that climate change can contribute to observable health effects that require medical treatment. Only a minority reported being “very” (6%) or “moderately” (18%) knowledgeable about the association between climate change and health impacts; conversely, many reported being only “modestly” (48%) or “not at all” knowledgeable (28%). Nearly half of respondents indicated that, outside of their role as a health professional, they had personally experienced climate change “a great deal” (10%), or a “moderate amount” (38%); others indicated “only a little” (40%), “not at all” (7%), or “don’t know” (7%.).</p>
