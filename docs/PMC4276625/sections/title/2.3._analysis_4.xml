 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Descriptive statistics were run on all variables, using unweighted data. The data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. All mean differences reported are deemed significant if 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05 in a two-way test. Confidence intervals (CI’s) were calculated using an online CI calculator [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-11-12473" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-11-12473">10</a>]. Based on the sample size, the approximate confidence intervals for any survey question was ± 5.8%, therefore any response items that differ less than 8.5% (the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences) should not be considered statistically different. Data was not weighted, but responses were segmented by region and were not statistically different from each other when calculated using ANOVA. No regions of the U.S. (Northeast, South, Mid-West, Southwest, and Pacific Northwest) or coastal location (states on a coastline 
  <span class="italic">vs.</span> landlocked states) differed significantly from the overall national responses. Open-ended comments were edited for minor grammar and spelling corrections, and some comments that did not directly address the question were removed from this report; personally identifying information included in responses is also not reported.
