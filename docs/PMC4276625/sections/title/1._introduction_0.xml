 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Third National Climate Assessment: 
  <span class="italic">Climate Change Impacts in the United States</span> (NCA3) [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-11-12473" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-11-12473">1</a>], published in May 2014, reported that health effects of global climate change are already evident in the United States. The Fifth Assessment Report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR 5), released a few months earlier in 2014, reached similar conclusions about the health impacts of climate change around the world [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-11-12473" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-11-12473">2</a>]. The risk of adverse respiratory effects due to poor air quality, health problems caused by heat events, and injuries attributable to extreme weather are found in the U.S. already and are likely to increase in the future. The spread of food-borne, vector-borne, and waterborne diseases, and harms to mental health are additional likely by-products of climate change.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NCA3 and IPCC AR5 reports—which were both based on a substantial number of peer-reviewed studies—offer clarity and consistency about health problems caused or worsened by climate change and raise an obvious and pressing question: Are the health problems associated with climate change being witnessed by practitioners of clinical medicine? If these problems are identifiable to researchers, it is reasonable to assume that practitioners would be seeing them. To answer this question, we surveyed members of a U.S. medical society to determine if a group of physicians in a likely position to witness the health effects from climate change were actually witnessing them in their practices, and to assess what actions, if any, they feel the medical community should be taking to address the problems.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The research was a collaborative effort between the National Medical Association (NMA) and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication (Mason 4C). NMA is the U.S. nonprofit medical association that has as its core mission representing African American physicians and their patients. It is dedicated to improving public health, eliminating health disparities and promoting parity in the practice of medicine. NMA members care for patients of all races and ethnicities, but as a group have a larger percentage of patients who are people of color than other medical societies. These patients are vulnerable for such reasons as low income or assets, environmental or social injustice, and pre-existing chronic disease. There is a growing literature documenting the disproportionate impact of climate change on the health of vulnerable people and communities [

  <a rid="B5-ijerph-11-12473" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-11-12473">5</a>]. Thus, physician members of NMA may have a key vantage point from which to observe possible health effects and consider needed actions.
