 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nearly all respondents feel the U.S. should take significant steps to reduce climate change (through prevention) and protect people from its harmful effects (through preparedness). Specifically, in response to the question 
  <span class="italic">“How big of an effort should the U.S. make to reduce the potential impacts of climate change (i.e., prevention)?”</span> a majority (55%) indicated “a large-scale effort, even if it has large economic costs”, while 38% indicated “a medium-scale effort, even if it has moderate economic costs,” and 7% indicated “ a small-scale effort, even if it has small economic costs;” only 1% indicated “no effort.” This question was intended to assess respondent’s preferences regarding the magnitude of climate change mitigation responses in terms that would be recognized by medical practitioners. Similarly, in response to the question 
  <span class="italic">“How big of an effort should the U.S. make to protect people from the potential harmful health effects caused by climate change (i.e., preparedness)?”</span> a majority (56%) indicated “a large-scale effort, even if it has large economic costs”, while 37% indicated “a medium-scale effort, even if it has moderate economic costs”, and 7% indicated “ a small-scale effort, even if it has small economic costs”; only 1% indicated “no effort.” This question was intended to assess respondent’s preferences regarding the magnitude of adaptation responses, but in familiar terms used to discuss medical care.
