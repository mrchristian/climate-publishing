 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> shows the mapping of the components of vulnerability, that is, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Cantons with the lowest adaptive capacity are located in the Northwest of Ecuador, in the province of Esmeraldas; in the Midwest, in the provinces of Manabí and Guayas; and in the East, in the Amazonian provinces of Orellana and Pastaza. In turn, the cantons with very high adaptive capacity are Quito, Guayaquil, and Machala, where some of the surrounding cantons also belong to the very high adaptive capacity category.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cantons with the highest exposure are also located in the Northwest of Ecuador, in the province of Esmeraldas, in the Midwest in the province of Manabi, and along the Amazonian region. The least exposed cantons are located mainly in the North and Central Regions of Ecuador, and Guayaquil, and some others to the South, in the provinces of Loja and Morona Santiago. The coastal zone is highly exposed, in particular, to the tropical monsoon climate (TMC), which extends to the Andean and Amazonian region. This climate pattern is regulated by atmospheric circulation and influences the seasonal changes of wind intensity and direction. Wind transports heat and moisture from the sea and produces variable effects in the Andean region. In addition, as a result of the elevation gradient of the Andean mountains the exposure of cantons in the Amazonian region is relatively low.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cantons with the highest sensitivity are mainly located to the Northwest and Midwest of Ecuador, with some other cantons in the Amazonian region. The least sensitive cantons are Quito, Guayaquil, Machala, and their surrounding areas, and others in the central region of Ecuador.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An implication from Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> is that the ordering from the composite indicator is not preserved for all components. For instance, although Quito is ranked as one of the least vulnerable cantons, because of its high adaptive capacity and low sensitivity, it is identified as highly exposed to climatic features. The same applies to Guayaquil, which is very highly exposed to climate but is one of the least vulnerable cantons in the country. On the other hand, a canton such as Sozoranga, which is in the less sensitive and very highly adaptive capacity categories, is ranked as one of those less exposed to climatic features. Similarly, Rumiñahui, a canton with very low sensitivity and high adaptive capacity, is highly exposed to climate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approximately 20 % of the population (2.9 million individuals) in Ecuador lives in cantons with high and very high vulnerability mainly because of limitations on adaptive capacity. A similar proportion appears for the population living in highly and very highly sensitive cantons. However, 64 % of the population (9.3 million individuals) lives in cantons that are considered highly and very highly exposed to climatic phenomena.</p>
