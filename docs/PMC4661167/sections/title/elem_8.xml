  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> shows the results of the EOF analysis. Each panel shows the first principal component (PC) and the share of variance explained. Temperature, wind velocity, and relative humidity show inter-annual variation, which may be interpreted as seasonal variation. Thus, correlating the temporal variation with the corresponding PC, at each location, quantifies the link between these climatic variables and the seasonal variations. Also, it is noticeable that these variables in western Ecuador show a better representation of the seasonal variation because the boundaries of this area include the significant climatic influences from the Pacific Ocean. The PCs of temperature, wind velocity, and relative humidity in eastern Ecuador represent the seasonal variation but with small perturbations as in this region there are significant orographic and vegetation differences that affect the behavior of these variables. Additionally, the PCs do not show a strong representation of extreme events such as El Niño or La Niña.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOF analysis of the monthly variation of precipitation resulted in a PC that did not show positive correlations. The monthly variation of precipitation is highly dispersed. For example, Northern Ecuador shows different values from the South because of the greater influence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This adds to the existing geophysical differences between the Eastern and Western zones. Hence, for EOF analysis of precipitation we use the yearly variation to obtain the PC at the geographic location of each of the cantons. As it may be observed in the first PC, both in Eastern and Western Ecuador, there is a strong signal at the occurrence period of events such as El Niño and La Niña in 1981 and 1984. The PCs explain 51.4 and 58.9 % of the yearly variation and result in positive correlations with the geographic locations of the cities.</p>

Intermediate values appear for some of the sensitivity indicators such as the proportion of population with no social security coverage (11th), the proportion of households living below the poverty line (13th), the proportion of irrigated agricultural land with respect to total agricultural land (14th), the proportion of households with proper sanitary facilities (18th), and the proportion of households where the head is a female (20th).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows the vulnerability categories. The cantons with the highest vulnerabilities are located to the northwest of Ecuador, in the province of Esmeraldas, to the Midwest, in the provinces of Manabi and Los Rios, and to the South, in the provinces of Loja and Morona Santiago. In addition, most of the cantons in the Amazonian region are either in the highly or very highly vulnerable categories. The least and less vulnerable cantons are located to the central region of the country, mainly in the provinces of Pichincha; others are in the South, in the province of El Oro. The least vulnerable cantons are Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, and, Quito, Ecuador’s capital. These are followed by Cuenca, the third largest city in the country, and other mid-size cities such as Riobamba, Esmeraldas, Machala, Ambato, Loja, and Santo Domingo where populations range between 190,000 and 505,000 inhabitants. The correlation between the composite vulnerability indicator and population size is −0.5. This result points to the fact that larger cantons are not significantly less vulnerable.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other smaller cantons, such as Mejia (pop. 81,335) and Marcelino Maridueña (pop. 12,033), are also in the less vulnerable categories. Arguably the proximity of Mejia to Quito and of Marcelino Maridueña to Guayaquil implies that the development facilities and infrastructure of large cities spill over to the adaptive capacity of surrounding smaller cantons. This situation may also explain the low vulnerability of other cantons such as Samborondon and Duran with respect to Guayaquil; Pasaje and Santa Rosa with respect to Machala; and Rumiñahui with respect to Quito. The situation does not, however, apply to cantons such as Salitre and Nobol, which despite their close proximity to Guayaquil (on average 20 miles), appear as highly vulnerable.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the category of moderately vulnerable cantons we find that Quevedo, Latacunga, and Babahoyo (where population size is at least 153,000 inhabitants) are not different, in terms of vulnerability, from other much smaller cantons such as Calvas (pop. 28,185), Macara (pop. 19,018), San Pedro de Huaca (pop. 7624), and Chaguarpamba (7161). This indicates that there is no clear pattern between population size and vulnerability to climate change. In the category of vulnerable cantons we find Portoviejo (pop. 280,029), which is one of the 10 most populated cantons in the country, as well as smaller cantons like Guaranda (pop. 25,001), Salinas (pop. 28,650), and Quilanga (pop. 4337).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the category of highly vulnerable cantons we have El Empalme (pop. 64,789), Santa Elena (pop. 30,920), Pallatanga (pop. 12,000) and Gualaquiza (pop. 7409). For the very highly vulnerable category we find mid-size cantons such as Lago Agrio (pop. 57,727), Pedro Carbo (pop. 31,337), Olmedo (pop. 4870), and Aguarico (pop. 1024), which is the canton with the highest vulnerability index.</p>

   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> shows the mapping of the components of vulnerability, that is, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Cantons with the lowest adaptive capacity are located in the Northwest of Ecuador, in the province of Esmeraldas; in the Midwest, in the provinces of Manabí and Guayas; and in the East, in the Amazonian provinces of Orellana and Pastaza. In turn, the cantons with very high adaptive capacity are Quito, Guayaquil, and Machala, where some of the surrounding cantons also belong to the very high adaptive capacity category.

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cantons with the highest exposure are also located in the Northwest of Ecuador, in the province of Esmeraldas, in the Midwest in the province of Manabi, and along the Amazonian region. The least exposed cantons are located mainly in the North and Central Regions of Ecuador, and Guayaquil, and some others to the South, in the provinces of Loja and Morona Santiago. The coastal zone is highly exposed, in particular, to the tropical monsoon climate (TMC), which extends to the Andean and Amazonian region. This climate pattern is regulated by atmospheric circulation and influences the seasonal changes of wind intensity and direction. Wind transports heat and moisture from the sea and produces variable effects in the Andean region. In addition, as a result of the elevation gradient of the Andean mountains the exposure of cantons in the Amazonian region is relatively low.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cantons with the highest sensitivity are mainly located to the Northwest and Midwest of Ecuador, with some other cantons in the Amazonian region. The least sensitive cantons are Quito, Guayaquil, Machala, and their surrounding areas, and others in the central region of Ecuador.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An implication from Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> is that the ordering from the composite indicator is not preserved for all components. For instance, although Quito is ranked as one of the least vulnerable cantons, because of its high adaptive capacity and low sensitivity, it is identified as highly exposed to climatic features. The same applies to Guayaquil, which is very highly exposed to climate but is one of the least vulnerable cantons in the country. On the other hand, a canton such as Sozoranga, which is in the less sensitive and very highly adaptive capacity categories, is ranked as one of those less exposed to climatic features. Similarly, Rumiñahui, a canton with very low sensitivity and high adaptive capacity, is highly exposed to climate.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approximately 20 % of the population (2.9 million individuals) in Ecuador lives in cantons with high and very high vulnerability mainly because of limitations on adaptive capacity. A similar proportion appears for the population living in highly and very highly sensitive cantons. However, 64 % of the population (9.3 million individuals) lives in cantons that are considered highly and very highly exposed to climatic phenomena.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the adaptive capacity indicators we find that agricultural land tenure (i.e. the proportion of households owning agricultural land with respect to total agricultural land) is not significantly different between the moderately vulnerable to the very highly vulnerable categories. In these groups on average 71 % of farmers own the land where they work. This figure increases to 85 % for the less vulnerable category. There is, however, a significant difference between the less and very highly vulnerable groups. In addition, for the proportion of the population working in agriculture, silviculture or hunting, 25.53 % work in cantons in the less vulnerable category. This figure increases to 52.35 % in the rest of the vulnerability categories.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indicator for institutional capacity is highest for the moderately vulnerable category, and lowest for the highly and very highly vulnerable categories. Significant differences may appear in confidence intervals using levels slightly lower than 95 %. Public funds per capita for environmental protection are highest for the less vulnerable category (32.18 US dollars) but there is wide variation across cantons. For the rest of the categories funds per capita are on average 12.45 US dollars.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The proportion of households with access to garbage collection service is highest in the less vulnerable category (82.08 %). This is significantly different compared with the moderately vulnerable (64.43 %), the vulnerable (56.89 %), and the highly and very highly vulnerable (45.51 %) categories. Similarly, on average the proportion of households with sewage treatment service is 81.55 % in the less vulnerable category but is 43.67 % in the very highly vulnerable category. A similar result is observed for the proportion of households receiving water through a public piped system: the proportion is 67.54 % in the less vulnerable category, 33.95 % in the highly vulnerable category, and 27.8 % in the very highly vulnerable.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding human capital as part of adaptive capacity, there is high variation in the proportion of population affected by natural disasters, where the average is 16.54 %. No significant differences are found across vulnerability categories. In addition, less than 10 % of the population across all vulnerability categories has private health insurance: 55 % of the population is not under social security coverage.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is also a high variation on the minimum distance to a large town in the less vulnerable category and the confidence intervals overlap across all categories.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the sensitivity indicators, adult illiteracy rate is significantly higher in the very highly vulnerable category (13.12 %), and lower in the less vulnerable (4.99 %) and moderately vulnerable (8.75 %) categories. For the remaining categories, the illiteracy rate averages 10.01 %. For crowded households, this proportion is lowest for the less vulnerable category (14.19 %) and is significantly different for the rest of the vulnerability categories (highly vulnerable 23.33 % and very highly vulnerable, 27.93 %). Population density is significantly larger in the less vulnerable category (180 inhabitants per square km) compared with the very highly vulnerable category. However, there is a high variation where no pattern is identified and confidence intervals overlap across all categories.</p>
