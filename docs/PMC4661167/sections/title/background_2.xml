 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines vulnerability as the degree to which geophysical, biological, and socio-economic systems are susceptible to, and unable to cope with adverse impacts of climate change (Houghton 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">1996</a>). As these impacts at local scales are uncertain, vulnerability assessments have become necessary (Adger et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2004</a>) to increase the understanding of climate-sensitive systems and to inform the specification of targets and allocation of funds. Other uses for assessments are to prioritize political and research efforts, to develop and to implement adaptation strategies (Füssel and Klein 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2006</a>); and to evaluate program/policy effectiveness in data-scarce regions (Adger et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2004</a>; Pandey and Jha 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The evolution of vulnerability assessments has revealed trends toward interdisciplinary analyses of the consequences of climate change, as well as integration with adaptation, environmental degradation, agricultural productivity, food security, population growth, and conflict research (Füssel and Klein 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2006</a>; Schilling et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though there is no uniform methodology to assess vulnerability and its components (i.e. exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity), all vulnerability assessments require a detailed contextual understanding of the relevant systems and of the multiple stressors (Füssel 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2010</a>). Assessments have been conducted at different geographic scales, such as watersheds, rural areas (Eakin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2005</a>), regions, countries, or worldwide (Pachauri et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2014</a>). These assessments have made use of a wide array of technical tools such as local-level case studies (O’Brien et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2004</a>; Sutanta et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2013</a>), resilience indicators (Brenkert and Malone 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2005</a>), bio-economic models (Schilling et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2012</a>), general equilibrium models (Parry et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2004</a>; Tol 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2002</a>), and cross-sectional studies (Mendelsohn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2006</a>). The selection of the appropriate approach depends on the research or policy questions addressed, the urgency of the threat, the geographical and temporal scope of the analysis, the reliability of future climate impact projections, the level of previous knowledge, and the availability of data, expertise, and other resources (Füssel and Klein 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2002</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2006</a>; Füssel 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless of the assessment approach, challenges arise when the regions analyzed are communities that suffer from food, health and environmental insecurity, poverty, economic inequalities, weak governance, deficient infrastructure and education, lack of access to appropriate resources, or poor capacity to deal with extreme events (Bele et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2013</a>). These issues are likely to determine the sensitivity of communities to climate change (Watson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">1998</a>). For example, poverty and inequality are associated with poor quality housing, which is easily damaged by floods or storms, and with the formation of vulnerable and marginalized groups that lack the financial resources for adaptation, and may be forced to settle in climate-exposed areas (Adger et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2004</a>). Thus, finding good-quality socioeconomic data at local scale and harmonizing them with climatic variables is a significant aspect of vulnerability research.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence, the purpose of this paper is to assess vulnerability to climate change at a local level in Ecuador. We rely on the statistical behavior of climatic and socioeconomic variables where the weighting and aggregation mechanism of the composite vulnerability indicator is similar to Iyengar and Sudarshan (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1982</a>) and Deepa et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2013</a>). Rather than assuming the variables contribute equally to the composite indicator, our assessment approach defines the weights or contributions of each variables with respect to the aggregated variability of all variables across cantons (i.e. the political-administrative division of Ecuador, see the Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Thus, through normalization, this approach mitigates the dominance of variables with large variance. Furthermore, it allows aggregation of variables to a measure of the overall variability that represents the multi-dimensionality of vulnerability (Leichenko and O’Brien 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2002</a>). We use a large number of economic, social, and environmental variables to construct the composite vulnerability indicator, and a contribution of this paper is the use of empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) and reanalysis datasets to incorporate the long-run and spatial patterns of the climatic variables.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assume that exposure to climate change affects the sensitivity of cantons where communities respond given their adaptive capacity. Thus, we separate the composite indicator into three components: (1) exposure: the condition of disadvantage due to the position or location of a subject, object or system at risk; (2) sensitivity: the degree of internal ability of a subject, object or system to meet a threat and receive a possible impact due to the occurrence of an adverse event; and (3) adaptive capacity: the ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to cope, absorb, and recover from the effects of an adverse event effectively and in a timely manner, considering the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions (Antwi-Agyei et al.
