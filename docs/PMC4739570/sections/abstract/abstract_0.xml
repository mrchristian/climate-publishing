  <span class="italic">Merremia peltata</span> is a species with uncertain status in the island nations of the Pacific region. It has been designated introduced and invasive in some countries whereas it is considered native in others. Recent increase in its abundance across some island landscapes have led to calls for its designation as an invasive species of environmental concern with biological control being suggested as a control strategy. Climate change will add to the complications of managing this species since changes in climate will influence its range limits. In this study, we develop a process‐oriented niche model of 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> using 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">CLIMEX</span> to investigate the impacts of climate change on its potential distribution. Information on the climatic requirements of 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> and its current geographic distribution were used to calibrate the model. The results indicate that under current climate, 273,132 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of the land area in the region is climatically unsuitable or marginal for 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> whereas 664,524 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> is suitable to highly suitable. Under current climate, areas of climatic suitability for 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> were identified on the archipelagos of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. By the end of the century, some archipelagos like Fiji, Hawaii, New Caledonia and Vanuatu will probably become more suitable while 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">PNG</span> and Solomon Islands become less suitable for 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span>. The results can be used to inform biosecurity planning, management and conservation strategies on islands.
