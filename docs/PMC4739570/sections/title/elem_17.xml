 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential distribution of 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> was modeled for historical climate and under future climate scenarios. The variable impacts that climate change may have on this species' potential distribution in the Pacific region were highlighted. The model provided a good fit to the current distribution of this species in the region as well as the Australian distribution which was reserved for model validation purposes. In general, range expansions are indicated for Fiji, Hawaii, New Caledonia and Vanuatu while a reduction in climatically suitable areas is indicated for PNG and Solomon Islands under future climate scenarios.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two GCMs are consistent in their projections of changes in potential distribution of 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> under future climate for Fiji, Hawaii and Vanuatu while some differences can be seen in the projections for the other four countries. In general the MIROC‐H projections indicate that larger areas will remain climatically suitable for 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> in the future compared to CSIRO‐Mk3.0. The MIROC‐H GCM predicts a temperature increase of approximately 4.31°C, while the CSIRO‐Mk3.0 GCM predicts an increase of 2.11°C by 2100 (Kriticos et al. 
  <a rid="ece31915-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0025">2011</a>). Their predictions for changes in precipitation levels also differ with CSIRO‐Mk3.0 predicting a 14% decrease in future mean annual rainfall while MIROC‐H predicts a 1% decrease (Chiew et al. 
  <a rid="ece31915-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0006">2009</a>). 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> is restricted by low rainfall (Paynter et al. 
  <a rid="ece31915-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0033">2006</a>) and so the larger decreases in rainfall predicted by CSIRO‐Mk3.0 would lead to reduced climatic suitability in the future under this GCM.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some archipelagos within the introduced and invasive range of 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> were identified as remaining climatically suitable for this species well into the future with range expansions projected for some of the small islands in these archipelagos that currently do not have 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span>. In these cases strategic control measures will be required to prevent its spread to presently unoccupied islands. The isolation and smaller size of these islands place them in a better position to prevent entry into areas that are currently unsuitable for 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> but will become climatically suitable in the future. However, for such measures to be successful, quarantine regulations and their enforcement will need to be strengthened. Furthermore, simple and low‐cost strategies such as weed alerts and low‐cost surveillance, especially around airports and ports, may be a worthwhile investment on the part of biosecurity agencies in these archipelagos (Taylor et al. 
  <a rid="ece31915-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0051">2012b</a>). The decrease in climatic suitability in the introduced and invasive range of 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> by the end of the century is encouraging, although many islands in these areas will likely remain climatically suitable in the short term. These results should be useful in prioritizing areas for eradication and in determining areas where containment would be cost‐effective (Taylor and Kumar 
  <a rid="ece31915-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0048">2013a</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future range expansions within the native range of 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> are positive; however, range contractions are of concern. The distribution maps from this study could be used to make decisions about conservation implications, particularly on islands where climate is projected to become unsuitable for this species by 2100. The projected distribution maps identify some areas within its native range where this species can persist as anthropogenic climate change progresses. In such cases, focusing management efforts on the changing disturbance patterns, both natural and anthropogenic may be useful. The investigation into the response of species such as 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> to changes in climate serves a dual purpose. The results can be used to inform biosecurity planning by assessing threat levels to native biodiversity on islands where it is introduced and invasive. They can also inform management and conservation strategies on islands where it is native but has become dominant due to other factors such as disturbance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All species may respond in unpredictable ways to multiple interacting factors associated with global change and this also applies to species that behave invasively (Bradley et al. 
  <a rid="ece31915-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0004">2010</a>). Rising temperatures and altered precipitation together with increased availability of resources from higher carbon dioxide levels and nitrogen deposition, as well as land use change will impact invasive species distributions (Dukes 
  <a rid="ece31915-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0010">2000</a>; Hulme 
  <a rid="ece31915-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0016">2009</a>). However, these impacts will not be limited to single species in isolation but will affect whole ecosystems. Therefore, the issue of future changes to the distribution of 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> will need to be viewed in this context of wider changes. Integrated assessments that investigate large‐scale changes to entire ecosystems in the Pacific region will be beneficial for managers coping with the impacts of global change on biodiversity. However, this can be a demanding task, both in terms of funding and organization due to the comprehensive and interdisciplinary nature of such assessments (Bradley et al. 
  <a rid="ece31915-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0004">2010</a>). The findings from species‐specific studies such as the one reported here can be useful for managing the impacts of climate change on biodiversity in the short term but also potentially contribute to broad scale assessments in the long‐term.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CLIMEX is based on the response of a species to climate and does not explicitly include nonclimatic factors such as dispersal potential and biotic interactions in the modeling process Taylor et al. 
   <a rid="ece31915-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0051">2012b</a>). The uncertainty related to future global greenhouse gas emission patterns also introduce further uncertainty to model projections (Kriticos et al. 
   <a rid="ece31915-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0024">2006</a>). Therefore, the results presented here should be interpreted as providing an 
   <span class="italic">indication</span> of the direction and magnitude of change that may be expected in the future (Taylor et al. 
   <a rid="ece31915-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0051">2012b</a>). The distribution maps provided here show areas of climatic suitability for 
   <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> and should not be treated as predicted future distributions. Other factors like lack of dispersal opportunities will also play a role in this species' potential future distribution.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The gridded climate datasets used in this study have a coarse resolution and may not reflect the climatic variation that can occur over small distances on the mountainous islands in the Pacific region. However, in the absence of finer resolution data sets, this study has utilized the best available data to perform the climate change modeling.</p>
