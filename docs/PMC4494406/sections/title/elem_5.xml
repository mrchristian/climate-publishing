  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One strategy for mitigating methane emissions with feed changes is by including more concentrates in addition to, or in place of, a proportion of dietary forage. Although emissions per animal may rise as productivity improves, there is generally a reduction in the greenhouse gases released on a per kg-product produced basis [
   <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>,
   <a rid="B13-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-animals-05-00361">13</a>]. In intensive production systems, grain feeding of livestock often entails removing cattle raised for beef from pastures to provide the finishing ration in a feedlot. This is a common system in the United States and is being emulated in other parts of the world, such as Latin America. In Brazil, the practice of finishing cattle in feedlots increased 50% (from two to three million animals) from 2003 to 2010 [
   <a rid="B14-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-animals-05-00361">14</a>].

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The digestive system of cattle is best adapted to roughage provided by grass-based diets [
   <a rid="B15-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-animals-05-00361">15</a>], and the natural behavior of cattle is to graze throughout the day. However, the typical routine in feedlots is to gradually reduce the proportion of forage in the ration over time, eventually reaching diets that can be as high as 90% grain [
   <a rid="B16-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-animals-05-00361">16</a>]. In enlarging Brazilian feedlots, the expected trend is a decrease in the amount of roughage in feedlot diets, with an already observed reduction from 29% in 2009 to 21% in 2011 [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In cattle feeding systems with high ratios of concentrate to forages, digestive problems are common. The starches in this concentrated diet are quickly digested and fermentation acids can build up disrupting the normal function of the rumen [
   <a rid="B16-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-animals-05-00361">16</a>]. Abnormal rumen function and digestive disorders can lead to acidosis, bloat, and if persistent, liver abscesses, and even the foot disorder laminitis [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both acidosis and bloat, increasing the amount of forage in the diet can stimulate chewing and promote saliva production, which have a buffering effect, and thus reduce the likelihood of a sinking pH level and destabilization of the microbial population in the rumen [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finishing calves in a feedlot usually involves transporting them from their natal pastures. In the United States, nearly two-thirds (63%) of cattle and calves raised for beef are sold through an auction barn after leaving the farm [
   <a rid="B22-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-animals-05-00361">22</a>], thus, many calves are moved twice before arrival at a feedlot.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In cases where intensification of animal agriculture is accompanied by better access to resources, then there may be benefits for welfare in terms of providing more nutritionally complete rations. However, pigs are also often fed highly concentrated grain-based diets in intensive production. Concentrated diets may be fed to pigs in a finely ground or pelleted ration and are expected to reduce GHG emissions due to their high digestibility. For example, in a case study of intensive pig production in East and South East Asia, the FAO explored changes to swine diets as a potential mitigation strategy, including increased digestibility of feed. In intermediate (not fully industrialized) systems, by changing the feed along with other management changes, emissions could be reduced by 32% to 38% [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pigsâ€™ stomachs are biologically designed for numerous, small meals throughout the day of high fiber feedstuffs [
   <a rid="B30-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-animals-05-00361">30</a>]. However, in intensive production, they have little access to roughage. Feed processing improves feed-to-gain efficiency, but it is also associated with intestinal problems. These low fiber diets can impact mucosa integrity leaving pigs prone to gastric ulcers in the pars esophageal region of the stomach [
   <a rid="B31-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-animals-05-00361">31</a>]. This is a problem worldwide. Reports vary, with incidence of pigs showing distinct signs of ulceration between farming operations ranging from zero to nearly 90% [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feed additives can be used to inhibit CH

   <sub>4</sub> as a sink for H
   <sub>2</sub> in the rumen, but feeding fumarate in its free acid form can lower rumen pH and inhibit fiber digestion, while feeding it in salt form can induce toxicity. Effective doses may well exceed current dietary recommendations [
