   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One strategy for mitigating methane emissions with feed changes is by including more concentrates in addition to, or in place of, a proportion of dietary forage. Although emissions per animal may rise as productivity improves, there is generally a reduction in the greenhouse gases released on a per kg-product produced basis [
    <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>,
    <a rid="B13-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-animals-05-00361">13</a>]. In intensive production systems, grain feeding of livestock often entails removing cattle raised for beef from pastures to provide the finishing ration in a feedlot. This is a common system in the United States and is being emulated in other parts of the world, such as Latin America. In Brazil, the practice of finishing cattle in feedlots increased 50% (from two to three million animals) from 2003 to 2010 [
    <a rid="B14-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-animals-05-00361">14</a>].

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The digestive system of cattle is best adapted to roughage provided by grass-based diets [
    <a rid="B15-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-animals-05-00361">15</a>], and the natural behavior of cattle is to graze throughout the day. However, the typical routine in feedlots is to gradually reduce the proportion of forage in the ration over time, eventually reaching diets that can be as high as 90% grain [
    <a rid="B16-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-animals-05-00361">16</a>]. In enlarging Brazilian feedlots, the expected trend is a decrease in the amount of roughage in feedlot diets, with an already observed reduction from 29% in 2009 to 21% in 2011 [
    <a rid="B17-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-animals-05-00361">17</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In cattle feeding systems with high ratios of concentrate to forages, digestive problems are common. The starches in this concentrated diet are quickly digested and fermentation acids can build up disrupting the normal function of the rumen [

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both acidosis and bloat, increasing the amount of forage in the diet can stimulate chewing and promote saliva production, which have a buffering effect, and thus reduce the likelihood of a sinking pH level and destabilization of the microbial population in the rumen [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finishing calves in a feedlot usually involves transporting them from their natal pastures. In the United States, nearly two-thirds (63%) of cattle and calves raised for beef are sold through an auction barn after leaving the farm [
    <a rid="B22-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-animals-05-00361">22</a>], thus, many calves are moved twice before arrival at a feedlot.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In cases where intensification of animal agriculture is accompanied by better access to resources, then there may be benefits for welfare in terms of providing more nutritionally complete rations. However, pigs are also often fed highly concentrated grain-based diets in intensive production. Concentrated diets may be fed to pigs in a finely ground or pelleted ration and are expected to reduce GHG emissions due to their high digestibility. For example, in a case study of intensive pig production in East and South East Asia, the FAO explored changes to swine diets as a potential mitigation strategy, including increased digestibility of feed. In intermediate (not fully industrialized) systems, by changing the feed along with other management changes, emissions could be reduced by 32% to 38% [

Feed processing improves feed-to-gain efficiency, but it is also associated with intestinal problems. These low fiber diets can impact mucosa integrity leaving pigs prone to gastric ulcers in the pars esophageal region of the stomach [
    <a rid="B31-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-animals-05-00361">31</a>]. This is a problem worldwide. Reports vary, with incidence of pigs showing distinct signs of ulceration between farming operations ranging from zero to nearly 90% [

    <span class="italic">in vitro</span> studies have shown that fumarate can work as an alternative to CH
    <sub>4</sub> as a sink for H
    <sub>2</sub> in the rumen, but feeding fumarate in its free acid form can lower rumen pH and inhibit fiber digestion, while feeding it in salt form can induce toxicity. Effective doses may well exceed current dietary recommendations [
    <a rid="B40-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-animals-05-00361">40</a>]. Especially in low protein diets, nitrates are also potential CH

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, as animals become more productive, greater feed intake is needed to support the energy requirements associated with growth or lactation, but the proportion of total energy requirements required for maintenance decreases [
   <a rid="B43-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-animals-05-00361">43</a>]. Thus the feed input per unit of product produced is reduced. Further, with increases in productivity, fewer animals are needed to reach a given level of output [
   <a rid="B43-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-animals-05-00361">43</a>]. In the climate change mitigation literature, this concept is often exemplified with dairy cows. For example, in 1944, the diverse breeds comprising the US dairy cow population produced an annual milk yield of 2074 kg per cow, but by 2007 the genetic pool had shrunk, and Holsteins were the dominant breed, while milk production more than quadrupled to 9193 kg per cow. In 1944 there were 25.6 million dairy cows in the United States with an annual production of 53.0 billion kg of milk, while in 2007 the total US dairy herd had declined to 9.2 million cows, but they produced 84.2 billion kg of milk. Because of this per cow increase in production, the total carbon footprint for the US dairy industry in 1944 was 194 million tons of CO

Between 1959 and 2009, there was a 29% increase in the number of hogs marketed in the United States, yet the size of the breeding herd has been reduced by 39%. This is due in part to the steady increase in litter size from 7.10 in 1974 to 9.97 piglets in 2011 and the concomitant change in the amount of pork produced from a single breeding animal from 775 to 1828 kg.

Despite this, the suggestion is that the type of throughput achieved in the United States, if adopted more widely in the developing world, could be an approach to climate change mitigation. However, some of the key unintended animal welfare consequences that may accompany such a change include low piglet viability and severe feed deprivation of breeding sows in order to prevent them from becoming obese.

However, the FAO also cautions that while achieving the genetic potential of highly productive breeds is important, these animals should not be imported into environments where climate or management limitations would prevent the animals from achieving this potential. In new regions or countries, animals from genetic lines with high production potential may actually perform worse than native breeds or crossbreeds, especially compared to those well-adapted to local disease and climactic conditions [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to increasing productivity within species, the current global trend toward intensively producing greater numbers of non-ruminant animals—pigs and chickens—is often viewed as a more efficient form of meat production compared to traditional ruminant cattle, sheep and goat rearing systems [
   <a rid="B134-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B134-animals-05-00361">134</a>,

   <a rid="B136-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B136-animals-05-00361">136</a>]. To meet the growing demand for animal protein in emerging economies [
   <a rid="B13-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-animals-05-00361">13</a>], the expansion in supply is largely coming from increased local production, as opposed to from imports [
   <a rid="B12-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-animals-05-00361">12</a>], and in these regions, livestock systems are rapidly shifting toward monogastric species. Pigs and poultry account for 77% of the expansion in production, a trend that is often accompanied by intensification, vertical integration, geographic concentration, up-scaling of production, and feeding more grain- or concentrate-based diets [
   <a rid="B12-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-animals-05-00361">12</a>]—in short, industrialized farming.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monogastrics have improved GHG efficiencies compared to cattle. Cattle accounted for 77% of total non-CO
   <sub>2</sub> GHG emissions from the livestock sector in 2000, while monogastrics accounted for just 10% [
   <a rid="B136-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B136-animals-05-00361">136</a>]. It takes at least three times as much land to produce one kilogram of beef as it does to produce one kilogram of pork or chicken [
   <a rid="B137-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B137-animals-05-00361">137</a>]. Cattle contribute about seven times the CO

   <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>]. This biological difference can be explained by three main factors: greater feed efficiency, lower enteric CH
   <sub>4</sub> emissions, and faster rates of reproduction. CH
   <sub>4</sub> emissions from ruminants originate from both manure and enteric fermentation, while CH
   <sub>4</sub> emissions from monogastrics are primarily associated with manure alone. Because sows and hens have a relatively large number of progeny and earlier sexual maturity, the number of breeding adults per animal slaughtered for human food is reduced in these production systems [
   <a rid="B137-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B137-animals-05-00361">137</a>]. Together, these factors account for the reduction in inputs and lower emissions of pig and poultry production worldwide.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the increasing consumption of animal protein in developing countries will be supplied in a substantial way by expansion of pork and chicken industries, and if the expansion will be in the form of specialized, intensive confinement facilities that typify the bulk of production in North America and other developed regions, then there is a serious potential for a concomitant increase in the animal welfare problems that characterize those systems.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As covered in 
   <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2dot3-animals-05-00361" href="#sec2dot2dot3-animals-05-00361">Section 2.2.3</a>, the intensive production of modern strains of poultry is the cause of one of the most severe and wide-spread animal welfare problems in the world. Globally, nearly 60 billion chickens are slaughtered for meat each year [
   <a rid="B138-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B138-animals-05-00361">138</a>], and given the wide prevalence of metabolic problems and painful leg disorders, the intensive production of meat chickens already constitutes one of the most problematic aspects of intensive agriculture. Sweeping calls to use 
   <span class="italic">more</span> of these compromised animals to meet efficiency goals is alarming.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an ethical analysis, overall welfare would be a function of both the state of the individual animal and the number of animals subjected to that level of welfare. It takes far more animals to produce the same amount of meat when beef is replaced in the diet with chicken, compounding the overall magnitude of any negative animal welfare impacts.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another of the most salient issues with intensive confinement of animals in agriculture is the way those animals are housed. Intensive systems for pork and poultry production remove animals from the land and instead raise them in indoor, total confinement facilities. While well-managed, large-scale production can have some animal welfare advantages, such as access to resources that might be economically out of reach to smaller producers, they often greatly limit the space allotment per animal. In the case of breeding sows in the pork production industry the animals are further partitioned into enclosures that prevent normal movement and severely restrict the animals’ natural behavior, which is a serious welfare problem.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Swine are highly intelligent, social animals with complex behavioral repertoires. Yet, in many countries, intensive production facilities house female breeding pigs in narrow gestation crates, metal stalls that measure approximately 0.61 m by 2.31 m, which is only slightly larger than the sow’s own body. Each sow can take a step forward and backward, but she cannot turn around for the length of her pregnancy, which is approximately 114 days. Due to decreased fitness from chronic lack of exercise, crated sows have lower bone strength and muscle weight [
    <a rid="B139-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B139-animals-05-00361">139</a>], and have higher resting heart rates [

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fed concentrated grain-based diets that can be consumed quickly, and without opportunity to express species-typical foraging behavior, sows in intensive confinement operations often begin to display abnormal, stereotypic behavior including repetitive bar-biting, head-weaving, sham-chewing and drinker pressing. Rooted in stress and lack of stimulation [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most large, industrialized confinement facilities for pigs utilize a liquid manure handling system with slatted floors. While a 2013 FAO review noted that slatted floor manure systems tend to decrease GHG and NH
    <sub>3</sub> emissions compared with deep litter systems [
    <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>], these bare, concrete floors are hard on the animals’ feet. One survey found that pigs allowed outdoor access had a lower prevalence of foot and limb injuries, while those confined indoors on hard, slatted flooring had more bruising, calluses, locomotion problems, and adventitious bursae [
    <a rid="B152-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B152-animals-05-00361">152</a>]. The problem is especially acute for piglets; foot and limb injuries affect 60% to 90% of young piglets housed indoors, while only about 9% of piglets housed outdoors suffer these types of injuries. While outdoor production does have its own suite of welfare concerns, including severe weather and predators, in farrowing huts common to pasture-based systems, soil covered with straw provides a soft, non-abrasive, protective surface [
    <a rid="B152-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B152-animals-05-00361">152</a>]. Behavioral testing has shown that pigs prefer earthen floors over concrete [

    <a rid="B154-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B154-animals-05-00361">154</a>]. While bedding, such as straw provides comfort, warmth and outlets for natural rooting and nesting behavior, it is not usually provided in indoor operations due to cost, difficulty of cleaning, and incompatibility with slatted floors.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are however, more welfare-friendly intensive systems. For example, sows can successfully be housed in group pens as opposed to individual gestation crates, as long as they are managed well to prevent aggression. Group housing systems work best if they deliver the feed in a non-competitive way, such as by using trickle feeding, feeding stalls, or Electronic Sow Feeding systems (which use a computer to precisely deliver each sow’s daily allotment) [
    <a rid="B155-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B155-animals-05-00361">155</a>]. Straw bedding can be incorporated into these systems in purpose-built un-slatted sections of the barn. However, N

    <a rid="B156-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B156-animals-05-00361">156</a>]. Further research on group housing systems design could focus on lowering emissions while simultaneously fulfilling the behavioral needs of the animals.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another problem with large, industrialized animal production sites is the ratio of animals to human caretakers. With increased farm size, new technologies and increased mechanization, such as automated feed and water delivery and manure removal, coupled with economic pressure to reduce labor, the result is that fewer workers now tend to more animals. As such, individualized attention to each animal is generally lacking. With the use of efficiencies in pen and barn design, one person may now be responsible for the care of 8000 pigs per day [
    <a rid="B157-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B157-animals-05-00361">157</a>] (p. 291). One of the main daily tasks on a commercial-scale broiler grow-out facility is picking up the dead birds. While large farms can be well managed to reduce death losses, the health of the animals on large operations is often addressed at the herd or flock level, and individual veterinary care is not generally provided. An individual animal who becomes injured or ill is likely to go unnoticed, and could experience prolonged pain and suffering before their eventual death.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On top of the animal welfare concerns, the industrialization of agriculture carries with it numerous other societal implications. Switching to large-scale use of monogastrics threatens genetic diversity, and subsequent genetic adaptation of domestic species to climate change [
    <a rid="B158-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B158-animals-05-00361">158</a>]. It could also mean the proliferation of more and more serious environmental issues, including air, soil, and water pollution. For example, the rapid expansion of pig production in the coastal areas of China, Vietnam, and Thailand is thought to be a major source of nutrient pollution in the South China Sea. Runoff is causing red tides and threatening fragile mangroves and coral reefs [
    <a rid="B12-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-animals-05-00361">12</a>] (p. 71). Concerns such as these must be properly weighed in the discussion of intensification and shifts to monogastric production as proposed climate change mitigation strategies.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">System changes, however, (e.g., from extensive to industrialized production) are not required for some of the most substantial emissions reductions, which can be achieved within production systems, across all species and regions. The FAO found that applying the techniques of 10% of the most efficient producers to current systems, by for example, improved pasture management and feed quality, and better animal health, among others could cut nearly a third of emissions from the farm animal sector. Production system changes further reduced emissions a mere 2% [
    <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>] (pp. 45–46). Clearly, there is a large opportunity to improve emissions by picking the low-hanging fruit,
