 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.4. Species Shifts</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to increasing productivity within species, the current global trend toward intensively producing greater numbers of non-ruminant animals—pigs and chickens—is often viewed as a more efficient form of meat production compared to traditional ruminant cattle, sheep and goat rearing systems [
  <a rid="B134-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B134-animals-05-00361">134</a>,
  <a rid="B135-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B135-animals-05-00361">135</a>,
  <a rid="B136-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B136-animals-05-00361">136</a>]. To meet the growing demand for animal protein in emerging economies [
  <a rid="B13-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-animals-05-00361">13</a>], the expansion in supply is largely coming from increased local production, as opposed to from imports [
  <a rid="B12-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-animals-05-00361">12</a>], and in these regions, livestock systems are rapidly shifting toward monogastric species. Pigs and poultry account for 77% of the expansion in production, a trend that is often accompanied by intensification, vertical integration, geographic concentration, up-scaling of production, and feeding more grain- or concentrate-based diets [
  <a rid="B12-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-animals-05-00361">12</a>]—in short, industrialized farming.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monogastrics have improved GHG efficiencies compared to cattle. Cattle accounted for 77% of total non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> GHG emissions from the livestock sector in 2000, while monogastrics accounted for just 10% [
  <a rid="B136-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B136-animals-05-00361">136</a>]. It takes at least three times as much land to produce one kilogram of beef as it does to produce one kilogram of pork or chicken [
  <a rid="B137-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B137-animals-05-00361">137</a>]. Cattle contribute about seven times the CO
  <sub>2</sub>-eq. emissions of pigs and chickens [
  <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>]. This biological difference can be explained by three main factors: greater feed efficiency, lower enteric CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions, and faster rates of reproduction. CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from ruminants originate from both manure and enteric fermentation, while CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from monogastrics are primarily associated with manure alone. Because sows and hens have a relatively large number of progeny and earlier sexual maturity, the number of breeding adults per animal slaughtered for human food is reduced in these production systems [
  <a rid="B137-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B137-animals-05-00361">137</a>]. Together, these factors account for the reduction in inputs and lower emissions of pig and poultry production worldwide.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the increasing consumption of animal protein in developing countries will be supplied in a substantial way by expansion of pork and chicken industries, and if the expansion will be in the form of specialized, intensive confinement facilities that typify the bulk of production in North America and other developed regions, then there is a serious potential for a concomitant increase in the animal welfare problems that characterize those systems.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As covered in 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2dot3-animals-05-00361" href="#sec2dot2dot3-animals-05-00361">Section 2.2.3</a>, the intensive production of modern strains of poultry is the cause of one of the most severe and wide-spread animal welfare problems in the world. Globally, nearly 60 billion chickens are slaughtered for meat each year [
  <a rid="B138-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B138-animals-05-00361">138</a>], and given the wide prevalence of metabolic problems and painful leg disorders, the intensive production of meat chickens already constitutes one of the most problematic aspects of intensive agriculture. Sweeping calls to use 
  <span class="italic">more</span> of these compromised animals to meet efficiency goals is alarming.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an ethical analysis, overall welfare would be a function of both the state of the individual animal and the number of animals subjected to that level of welfare. It takes far more animals to produce the same amount of meat when beef is replaced in the diet with chicken, compounding the overall magnitude of any negative animal welfare impacts.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another of the most salient issues with intensive confinement of animals in agriculture is the way those animals are housed. Intensive systems for pork and poultry production remove animals from the land and instead raise them in indoor, total confinement facilities. While well-managed, large-scale production can have some animal welfare advantages, such as access to resources that might be economically out of reach to smaller producers, they often greatly limit the space allotment per animal. In the case of breeding sows in the pork production industry the animals are further partitioned into enclosures that prevent normal movement and severely restrict the animals’ natural behavior, which is a serious welfare problem.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.4.1. Industrial Production of Pigs</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Swine are highly intelligent, social animals with complex behavioral repertoires. Yet, in many countries, intensive production facilities house female breeding pigs in narrow gestation crates, metal stalls that measure approximately 0.61 m by 2.31 m, which is only slightly larger than the sow’s own body. Each sow can take a step forward and backward, but she cannot turn around for the length of her pregnancy, which is approximately 114 days. Due to decreased fitness from chronic lack of exercise, crated sows have lower bone strength and muscle weight [
   <a rid="B139-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B139-animals-05-00361">139</a>], and have higher resting heart rates [
   <a rid="B140-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B140-animals-05-00361">140</a>], compared to those permitted more freedom of movement and exercise.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fed concentrated grain-based diets that can be consumed quickly, and without opportunity to express species-typical foraging behavior, sows in intensive confinement operations often begin to display abnormal, stereotypic behavior including repetitive bar-biting, head-weaving, sham-chewing and drinker pressing. Rooted in stress and lack of stimulation [
   <a rid="B141-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B141-animals-05-00361">141</a>,
   <a rid="B142-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B142-animals-05-00361">142</a>], these “stereotypies”, are common in captive animals kept in barren, restrictive environments [
   <a rid="B143-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B143-animals-05-00361">143</a>]. Stereotypic behavior is often reduced when sows are fed a high fiber, bulky diet instead of, or in addition to, concentrates [

   <a rid="B148-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B148-animals-05-00361">148</a>], although some fiber sources, such as soybean hulls, may be less effective [
   <a rid="B149-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B149-animals-05-00361">149</a>]. Ethologists attribute this stereotypic behavior to boredom and frustration resulting from an impoverished environment, confinement, restraint, and unfulfilled behavioral needs [
   <a rid="B150-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B150-animals-05-00361">150</a>,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most large, industrialized confinement facilities for pigs utilize a liquid manure handling system with slatted floors. While a 2013 FAO review noted that slatted floor manure systems tend to decrease GHG and NH
   <sub>3</sub> emissions compared with deep litter systems [
   <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>], these bare, concrete floors are hard on the animals’ feet. One survey found that pigs allowed outdoor access had a lower prevalence of foot and limb injuries, while those confined indoors on hard, slatted flooring had more bruising, calluses, locomotion problems, and adventitious bursae [
   <a rid="B152-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B152-animals-05-00361">152</a>]. The problem is especially acute for piglets; foot and limb injuries affect 60% to 90% of young piglets housed indoors, while only about 9% of piglets housed outdoors suffer these types of injuries. While outdoor production does have its own suite of welfare concerns, including severe weather and predators, in farrowing huts common to pasture-based systems, soil covered with straw provides a soft, non-abrasive, protective surface [
   <a rid="B152-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B152-animals-05-00361">152</a>]. Behavioral testing has shown that pigs prefer earthen floors over concrete [
   <a rid="B153-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B153-animals-05-00361">153</a>,
   <a rid="B154-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B154-animals-05-00361">154</a>]. While bedding, such as straw provides comfort, warmth and outlets for natural rooting and nesting behavior, it is not usually provided in indoor operations due to cost, difficulty of cleaning, and incompatibility with slatted floors.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are however, more welfare-friendly intensive systems. For example, sows can successfully be housed in group pens as opposed to individual gestation crates, as long as they are managed well to prevent aggression. Group housing systems work best if they deliver the feed in a non-competitive way, such as by using trickle feeding, feeding stalls, or Electronic Sow Feeding systems (which use a computer to precisely deliver each sow’s daily allotment) [
   <a rid="B155-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B155-animals-05-00361">155</a>]. Straw bedding can be incorporated into these systems in purpose-built un-slatted sections of the barn. However, N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions in a straw-based, deep litter group housing systems are usually greater compared to concrete slatted floors [
   <a rid="B156-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B156-animals-05-00361">156</a>]. Further research on group housing systems design could focus on lowering emissions while simultaneously fulfilling the behavioral needs of the animals.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.4.2. Further Disadvantages of Shifting Production Systems</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another problem with large, industrialized animal production sites is the ratio of animals to human caretakers. With increased farm size, new technologies and increased mechanization, such as automated feed and water delivery and manure removal, coupled with economic pressure to reduce labor, the result is that fewer workers now tend to more animals. As such, individualized attention to each animal is generally lacking. With the use of efficiencies in pen and barn design, one person may now be responsible for the care of 8000 pigs per day [
   <a rid="B157-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B157-animals-05-00361">157</a>] (p. 291). One of the main daily tasks on a commercial-scale broiler grow-out facility is picking up the dead birds. While large farms can be well managed to reduce death losses, the health of the animals on large operations is often addressed at the herd or flock level, and individual veterinary care is not generally provided. An individual animal who becomes injured or ill is likely to go unnoticed, and could experience prolonged pain and suffering before their eventual death.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On top of the animal welfare concerns, the industrialization of agriculture carries with it numerous other societal implications. Switching to large-scale use of monogastrics threatens genetic diversity, and subsequent genetic adaptation of domestic species to climate change [
   <a rid="B158-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B158-animals-05-00361">158</a>]. It could also mean the proliferation of more and more serious environmental issues, including air, soil, and water pollution. For example, the rapid expansion of pig production in the coastal areas of China, Vietnam, and Thailand is thought to be a major source of nutrient pollution in the South China Sea. Runoff is causing red tides and threatening fragile mangroves and coral reefs [
   <a rid="B12-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-animals-05-00361">12</a>] (p. 71). Concerns such as these must be properly weighed in the discussion of intensification and shifts to monogastric production as proposed climate change mitigation strategies.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">System changes, however, (e.g., from extensive to industrialized production) are not required for some of the most substantial emissions reductions, which can be achieved within production systems, across all species and regions. The FAO found that applying the techniques of 10% of the most efficient producers to current systems, by for example, improved pasture management and feed quality, and better animal health, among others could cut nearly a third of emissions from the farm animal sector. Production system changes further reduced emissions a mere 2% [
   <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>] (pp. 45–46). Clearly, there is a large opportunity to improve emissions by picking the low-hanging fruit, 
   <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the least efficient producers [
   <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>,
   <a rid="B159-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B159-animals-05-00361">159</a>], while achieving multiple benefits, such as animal welfare, or at least avoiding additional negative impacts. Such improvements should also aim at improved food security (not just increased production) and fit well within the concept of “sustainable intensification” [
   <a rid="B160-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B160-animals-05-00361">160</a>].
