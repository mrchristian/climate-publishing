 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some authors are calling attention to the wide application of growth promoting technologies, including β-adrenergic agonists (βAAs) and recombinant bovine somatotrophin (rbST), for their climate change mitigation potential [
  <a rid="B108-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108-animals-05-00361">108</a>,
  <a rid="B109-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109-animals-05-00361">109</a>]. While the research to date has focused on US production systems, the call is being made in the context of meeting increasing global demand for animal protein. Zilpaterol hydorchloride and ractopamine hydrochloride are βAAs that are used as feed additives in grain rations for cattle [
  <a rid="B110-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110-animals-05-00361">110</a>]. βAAs are fed in a 20–40 day period prior to slaughter to improve feed efficiency and weight gain [
  <a rid="B111-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B111-animals-05-00361">111</a>]. The growth hormone rbST is used in the dairy industry to increase milk yield and feed conversion efficiency [
  <a rid="B108-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108-animals-05-00361">108</a>]. However, both rbST and βAAs are cause for substantial animal welfare concern [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) modeling, Stackhouse 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2012) found that the use of βAAs, in combination with antibiotics, ionophores, and hormone implants, as is common in US feedlots, decreased the carbon footprint of Angus beef production by 9% [
   <a rid="B109-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109-animals-05-00361">109</a>], and therefore advocated their use as a potential mitigation option. Cooprider 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2011) calculated that feedlot cattle fed ractopamine hydrochloride along with hormone implants and antibiotics had a 31% decrease in emissions per finished steer given the improved feed efficiency [
   <a rid="B114-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B114-animals-05-00361">114</a>]. However, anecdotal reports of changes in behavior and more cattle deaths when βAAs were being fed has led researchers to investigate [
   <a rid="B109-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109-animals-05-00361">109</a>]. One recent study found that cattle fed βAAs along with a growth implant (trenbolone acetate and estradiol) engaged in more agonistic behavior including bulling and pushing [
   <a rid="B115-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B115-animals-05-00361">115</a>]. A large-scale investigation by two major US agricultural universities examined datasets provided by feedlot operators also confirmed the field observations, finding that the cumulative death rate is as much as 90% greater in animals administered a βAA, and that 40%–50% of deaths among groups administered a βAA could be explained by administration of the drug [
   <a rid="B110-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110-animals-05-00361">110</a>]. Imports of animal products containing beta agonists is banned in many countries, including the EU, Russia, and China [
   <a rid="B116-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116-animals-05-00361">116</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The βAA ractopamine hydrochloride is also fed to swine, where the side-effects that have been elucidated to date include elevated heart rate, difficulty walking [
   <a rid="B117-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B117-animals-05-00361">117</a>], increased aggression [

   <a rid="B120-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B120-animals-05-00361">120</a>]. Observations at slaughter plants additionally find that difficulty walking due to ractopamine may contribute to a greater incidence of non-ambulatory (or “downed”) pigs, those too weak to stand and walk on their own accord [
   <a rid="B117-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B117-animals-05-00361">117</a>]. The number of studies investigating the animal welfare effects of βAAs is, thus far, small, but given the problems identified already, calls for their increased use clearly should be made more cautiously.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also called Bovine Growth Hormone, rbST is a protein hormone that redirects nutrient partitioning during lactation and can increase milk yield by 8%–36% [
   <a rid="B121-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B121-animals-05-00361">121</a>]. On a per unit of milk produced basis, it has been show that rbST reduces the maintenance energy and protein requirements of cows by 11.8% and 7.5%, respectively, and total feed requirements by 8.1% [
   <a rid="B121-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B121-animals-05-00361">121</a>]. It also reduces N excretion on a per liter of milk produced basis. Although overall N excretion increases in rbST treated cows, because they consume more feed, each cow produces more milk, so estimates calculated on a per liter basis report a reduction in nitrogen excretion between approximately 9% [
   <a rid="B108-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108-animals-05-00361">108</a>] and 15% [
   <a rid="B122-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B122-animals-05-00361">122</a>]. Per unit of milk, the dilution of maintenance conferred by the use of rbST can result in a reduction in manure production by 6.8% and CH
   <sub>4</sub> output by 7.3% [
   <a rid="B108-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108-animals-05-00361">108</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While rbST is banned in the European Union, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand [
   <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>], the drug is approved in the United States, despite substantial controversy. One of the primary welfare concerns associated with the increased milk production caused by rbST is the potential risk for mastitis. Some of the initial studies on rbST indicated that its use was linked to an increase (for example, Burton 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>., 1990 [
   <a rid="B123-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B123-animals-05-00361">123</a>] and Pell 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>., 1992 [
   <a rid="B124-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B124-animals-05-00361">124</a>], but see White 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>., 1994 [
   <a rid="B53-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-animals-05-00361">53</a>] for counter examples).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A 1999 report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare (SCAHAW), a working party of independent scientists appointed by the European Commission to assess rbST, reviewed approximately two dozen studies and concluded that rbST usage increases the risk of clinical mastitis and the length of infections [
   <a rid="B113-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113-animals-05-00361">113</a>]. This finding was supported by a review published by the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA) [
   <a rid="B112-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B112-animals-05-00361">112</a>]. The CVMA performed a series of meta-analyses to combine data from all randomized clinical trials that had been published in peer-reviewed journals or which were provided by Health Canada for the registration of rbST in the country. The CVMA found that rbST increased the risk of clinical mastitis by approximately 25%, closely agreeing with the SCAHAW report. Subsequently, rbST was not approved for use in Canada, due to animal health concerns.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The debate between researchers in different countries largely centers on the question of whether increases in mastitis are due to rbST treatment 
   <span class="italic">per se</span> or to the increase in productivity caused by rbST, the same as would be expected when genetic selection leads to greater milk production. White 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> (1994) argue that treatment differences in mastitis are within the range predicted using estimates from genetic studies. And using this logic they conclude that rbST treatment had no effect on mastitis [
   <a rid="B53-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-animals-05-00361">53</a>]. In contrast, SCAHAW (1999) argue that what matters is the result on the welfare of the animals, which is the same whether it is the drug itself or the increase in productivity that causes the mastitis [
   <a rid="B113-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113-animals-05-00361">113</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to problems with mastitis, there is also concern that rbST treatment may increase the risk of lameness and foot and leg disorders. While many early studies failed to find a detectable difference between rbST treated and control animals [
   <a rid="B121-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B121-animals-05-00361">121</a>,
   <a rid="B125-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B125-animals-05-00361">125</a>,
   <a rid="B126-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B126-animals-05-00361">126</a>,
   <a rid="B127-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B127-animals-05-00361">127</a>,
   <a rid="B128-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B128-animals-05-00361">128</a>,
   <a rid="B129-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B129-animals-05-00361">129</a>], others found a slight increase in the number of cows culled due to lameness [
   <a rid="B130-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B130-animals-05-00361">130</a>] and slightly more feet and leg problems [
   <a rid="B130-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B130-animals-05-00361">130</a>,
   <a rid="B131-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B131-animals-05-00361">131</a>]. As with the early work on mastitis and rbST, in studies with small cow numbers, low statistical power may have prevented detection of effects, and slight increases would be hard to find.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, both the SCAHAW committee and the CVMA review panel found an increased incidence of foot and leg disorders associated with the long-term administration of rbST [
   <a rid="B112-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B112-animals-05-00361">112</a>,
   <a rid="B113-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113-animals-05-00361">113</a>]. The CVMA review panel found that cows treated with rbST were at an estimated 55% increase in the risk of developing clinical signs of lameness, and this is now reflected on the Posilac drug label, which states “Cows injected with Posilac may have more enlarged hocks and disorders of the foot region” [
   <a rid="B132-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B132-animals-05-00361">132</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recombinant bovine Somatotropin has also been shown to reduce the ability of cows to cope with high environmental temperatures, which can lead to heat stress [
   <a rid="B113-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113-animals-05-00361">113</a>,
   <a rid="B133-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B133-animals-05-00361">133</a>]. It is, thus, not advisable in geographic regions where severe heat can be expected, especially if management options to alleviate heat stress are insufficient.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clearly the use of rbST carries unintended risks to the welfare of animals, and these should be seriously considered before such growth-promoting compounds are touted as a possible mitigation strategy for climate change.</p>
