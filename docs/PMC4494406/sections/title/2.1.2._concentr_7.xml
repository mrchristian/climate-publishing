 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In cases where intensification of animal agriculture is accompanied by better access to resources, then there may be benefits for welfare in terms of providing more nutritionally complete rations. However, pigs are also often fed highly concentrated grain-based diets in intensive production. Concentrated diets may be fed to pigs in a finely ground or pelleted ration and are expected to reduce GHG emissions due to their high digestibility. For example, in a case study of intensive pig production in East and South East Asia, the FAO explored changes to swine diets as a potential mitigation strategy, including increased digestibility of feed. In intermediate (not fully industrialized) systems, by changing the feed along with other management changes, emissions could be reduced by 32% to 38% [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pigsâ€™ stomachs are biologically designed for numerous, small meals throughout the day of high fiber feedstuffs [
  <a rid="B30-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-animals-05-00361">30</a>]. However, in intensive production, they have little access to roughage. Feed processing improves feed-to-gain efficiency, but it is also associated with intestinal problems. These low fiber diets can impact mucosa integrity leaving pigs prone to gastric ulcers in the pars esophageal region of the stomach [
  <a rid="B31-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-animals-05-00361">31</a>]. This is a problem worldwide. Reports vary, with incidence of pigs showing distinct signs of ulceration between farming operations ranging from zero to nearly 90% [

  <a rid="B37-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-animals-05-00361">37</a>]. The production systems in which most pigs are kept appear to have a large impact on the incidence of these ulcers, as pigs with access to straw, sawdust, or outdoor paddocks have fewer ulcers than those confined on bare, solid or slatted concrete floors [
