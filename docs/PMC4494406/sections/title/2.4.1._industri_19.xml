 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Swine are highly intelligent, social animals with complex behavioral repertoires. Yet, in many countries, intensive production facilities house female breeding pigs in narrow gestation crates, metal stalls that measure approximately 0.61 m by 2.31 m, which is only slightly larger than the sow’s own body. Each sow can take a step forward and backward, but she cannot turn around for the length of her pregnancy, which is approximately 114 days. Due to decreased fitness from chronic lack of exercise, crated sows have lower bone strength and muscle weight [
  <a rid="B139-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B139-animals-05-00361">139</a>], and have higher resting heart rates [
  <a rid="B140-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B140-animals-05-00361">140</a>], compared to those permitted more freedom of movement and exercise.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fed concentrated grain-based diets that can be consumed quickly, and without opportunity to express species-typical foraging behavior, sows in intensive confinement operations often begin to display abnormal, stereotypic behavior including repetitive bar-biting, head-weaving, sham-chewing and drinker pressing. Rooted in stress and lack of stimulation [
  <a rid="B141-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B141-animals-05-00361">141</a>,
  <a rid="B142-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B142-animals-05-00361">142</a>], these “stereotypies”, are common in captive animals kept in barren, restrictive environments [
  <a rid="B143-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B143-animals-05-00361">143</a>]. Stereotypic behavior is often reduced when sows are fed a high fiber, bulky diet instead of, or in addition to, concentrates [

  <a rid="B148-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B148-animals-05-00361">148</a>], although some fiber sources, such as soybean hulls, may be less effective [
  <a rid="B149-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B149-animals-05-00361">149</a>]. Ethologists attribute this stereotypic behavior to boredom and frustration resulting from an impoverished environment, confinement, restraint, and unfulfilled behavioral needs [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most large, industrialized confinement facilities for pigs utilize a liquid manure handling system with slatted floors. While a 2013 FAO review noted that slatted floor manure systems tend to decrease GHG and NH
  <sub>3</sub> emissions compared with deep litter systems [
  <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>], these bare, concrete floors are hard on the animals’ feet. One survey found that pigs allowed outdoor access had a lower prevalence of foot and limb injuries, while those confined indoors on hard, slatted flooring had more bruising, calluses, locomotion problems, and adventitious bursae [
  <a rid="B152-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B152-animals-05-00361">152</a>]. The problem is especially acute for piglets; foot and limb injuries affect 60% to 90% of young piglets housed indoors, while only about 9% of piglets housed outdoors suffer these types of injuries. While outdoor production does have its own suite of welfare concerns, including severe weather and predators, in farrowing huts common to pasture-based systems, soil covered with straw provides a soft, non-abrasive, protective surface [
  <a rid="B152-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B152-animals-05-00361">152</a>]. Behavioral testing has shown that pigs prefer earthen floors over concrete [
  <a rid="B153-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B153-animals-05-00361">153</a>,
  <a rid="B154-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B154-animals-05-00361">154</a>]. While bedding, such as straw provides comfort, warmth and outlets for natural rooting and nesting behavior, it is not usually provided in indoor operations due to cost, difficulty of cleaning, and incompatibility with slatted floors.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are however, more welfare-friendly intensive systems. For example, sows can successfully be housed in group pens as opposed to individual gestation crates, as long as they are managed well to prevent aggression. Group housing systems work best if they deliver the feed in a non-competitive way, such as by using trickle feeding, feeding stalls, or Electronic Sow Feeding systems (which use a computer to precisely deliver each sow’s daily allotment) [
  <a rid="B155-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B155-animals-05-00361">155</a>]. Straw bedding can be incorporated into these systems in purpose-built un-slatted sections of the barn. However, N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions in a straw-based, deep litter group housing systems are usually greater compared to concrete slatted floors [
  <a rid="B156-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B156-animals-05-00361">156</a>]. Further research on group housing systems design could focus on lowering emissions while simultaneously fulfilling the behavioral needs of the animals.
