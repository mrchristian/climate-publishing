 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While selective breeding has been successful in producing cows that yield more milk with less feed, this change is not without costs. Detrimental, unintended side-effects on the health of dairy cows have accompanied the physiological demands of greater productivity [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the birth of her calf, a dairy cow enters a state of negative energy balance. Genetic selection for increased milk yield increases feed intake, but high yielding cows can experience greater negative energy balance [
  <a rid="B47-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-animals-05-00361">47</a>] than cows producing less, so they are vulnerable to health problems. There is a strong correlation between maximum metabolic load and laminitis [
  <a rid="B48-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-animals-05-00361">48</a>], lameness and ketosis [
  <a rid="B49-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-animals-05-00361">49</a>,
  <a rid="B50-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-animals-05-00361">50</a>]. Failure to meet the nutritional demands of highly productive dairy cows can also lead to an array of additional metabolic diseases including fatty liver disease, ketosis and periparturient hypocalcemic paresis (milk fever) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mastitis, a bacterial infection of the udder, is the most commonly reported health problem in the US dairy industry, affecting 16.5% of cows [
  <a rid="B52-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-animals-05-00361">52</a>]. The udder and teats of mastitic cows are sensitive to the touch, and in severe cases, clinical signs include swelling and pain sometimes accompanied by fever and depression. It is one of the leading reasons for culling of cows [
  <a rid="B52-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-animals-05-00361">52</a>]. Although there are many risk factors for mastitis, such as lack of cleanliness in cow housing areas, research has consistently shown an association between mastitis and the amount of milk produced. For example, a study of over 3000 cows in 85 trials in eight different countries found that even with similar management conditions, higher yielding cows contracted more mastitis than lower yielding cows [
  <a rid="B53-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-animals-05-00361">53</a>]. Many studies have reported that milk yield and mastitis are genetically correlated [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further, high genetic merit dairy cows require high energy feeds to meet the substantial energy demands of early lactation. They often receive a high proportion of cereal grains, and one model found that cows selected for greater milk fat and protein fed a 50% grain diet had lower emissions (1.05 kg CO
  <sub>2</sub>-eq. per kilogram of energy-corrected milk), than cows with a 25% grain diet and summer grazing (1.19 kg per kilogram of energy-corrected milk) [
  <a rid="B60-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60-animals-05-00361">60</a>]. However, dairy cows are prone to digestive disorders such as sub-acute ruminal acidosis (SARA) [
  <a rid="B61-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61-animals-05-00361">61</a>,
  <a rid="B62-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-animals-05-00361">62</a>]. Diets that are rich in grains alter rumen metabolic balance and can induce an explosive proliferation of 
  <span class="italic">Streptococcus bovis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Lactobacillus</span> bacteria species. [
  <a rid="B63-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-animals-05-00361">63</a>]. The resulting rumen acidosis eventually leads to erosion and ulceration of the ruminal epithelium and chronic symptoms including lethargy, reduced feed intake, diarrhea, and discomfort among others.
