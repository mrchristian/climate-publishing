 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to improving animal health, nutrition or longevity, a great many more climate change mitigation options remain that could be used without negatively affecting the welfare of animals. Ruminants may be key parts to well-managed, mixed crop-livestock systems, helping to reduce a number of environmental impacts [
  <a rid="B192-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B192-animals-05-00361">192</a>]. Well-managed grazing can improve soil organic carbon and nitrogen content [
  <a rid="B193-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B193-animals-05-00361">193</a>] and partially offset net GHG emissions [
  <a rid="B194-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B194-animals-05-00361">194</a>]. Most manure management options are probably welfare-neutral, unless collection systems require the intensive confinement of animals. Hristov 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2013) provide a thorough summary of such options including reducing manure storage time, composting, and carefully timed land application [

Several techniques for manure application also hold mitigation promise, for example subsurface application, application during non-rainy periods, and controlling soil pH. Perennial crops can be used to improve soil structure, water retention capacity and, in turn, carbon sequestration capacity [
  <a rid="B195-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B195-animals-05-00361">195</a>]. Converting from conventional tilling to conservation or no-till cropping practices, especially with the simultaneous use of cover crops, can reduce soil disturbance and improve soil biodiversity and is another way to sequester carbon [
  <a rid="B196-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B196-animals-05-00361">196</a>]. Other options include restoration of degraded range land (re-vegetation, water conservation) [

  <a rid="B198-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B198-animals-05-00361">198</a>], and silvopastoral and agroforestry systems [
