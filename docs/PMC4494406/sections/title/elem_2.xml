 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is arguably the most important environmental issue of our time. With severe and widespread destructive effects, warming of the planet threatens ecological systems, peoples’ livelihoods, and species survival [
  <a rid="B1-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-animals-05-00361">1</a>]. Animal agriculture is an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and has been implicated as a serious contributor to climate change [
  <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>]. To reduce the contribution of emissions attributable to animal agriculture, a number of mitigation strategies involving changes to farming practices have been proposed. Although this is an important and timely goal, and many of the proposed solutions seem reasonable on the surface, mitigation strategies can have complex effects on people and animals in practice. While there has been occasional mention [
  <a rid="B3-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-animals-05-00361">3</a>], in the global discussion on climate change there has generally been a dearth of attention paid to the animal welfare impacts of the proposed abatement options [

  <a rid="B5-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-animals-05-00361">5</a>], and some of the suggested livestock management approaches would have severe and wide-ranging impacts on the animals.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the same time, in other arenas there is a growing international social movement afoot aimed at addressing animal welfare, the physical and psychological state of animals [
  <a rid="B6-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-animals-05-00361">6</a>]. There are many animal welfare issues associated with commercial farming practices, especially in industrial agricultural production systems, where animals are often confined indoors at high stocking densities. The conditions in which the animals are kept are a matter of serious deliberation in legislative, corporate, investment and trade organizations, among many others around the world. Overarching calls to increase animal productivity, by, for example, pushing animals (either genetically through selective breeding, with hormone drugs, or through feed changes) to produce more milk or meat, or to produce more offspring faster, can also be considered in light of potential health and welfare consequences.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper argues that the potential impact of climate change mitigation strategies on animal welfare should be acknowledged and considered in the ongoing debate and discussion centered on climate change approaches and climate change research, with the aim of maximizing co-benefits of sustainability while avoiding negative tradeoffs. Specific mitigation strategies are discussed and their potential impacts on the animals are assessed. As examples of alternative pathways forward, some mitigation approaches that have no effect on animal welfare or even a positive effect are also reviewed. Given the scope and severity of the impacts on animals, and the increasing global support for more welfare-friendly practices, animal welfare concerns should become a more prominent part of the dialog and policy decisions on climate change mitigation practices in animal agriculture.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Background on Climate Change and Mitigation Strategies</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Earth’s surface has been successively warmer over each of the last three decades compared to any preceding decade since 1850 [
   <a rid="B7-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-animals-05-00361">7</a>]. Human activities are responsible (with a 95%–100% probability) for the recent global warming and the marked increase in global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO
   <sub>2</sub>), methane (CH
   <sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N
   <sub>2</sub>O) to above pre-industrial values [
   <a rid="B8-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-animals-05-00361">8</a>]. By sector, greenhouse gas pollution originates primarily from industry; agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU); buildings; and transport [
   <a rid="B9-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-animals-05-00361">9</a>]. Separated out, animal agriculture emits a significant portion, estimated from 7% to 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions [
   <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Livestock contribute both directly and indirectly to climate change. Enteric fermentation and manure associated emissions are direct, while production and transport of feed (including the fossil fuels used in manufacturing chemical fertilizers) and land use changes (such as conversion of forest to pasture and crop land) contribute indirectly [
   <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>]. About 44% of the emissions generated by livestock are CH
   <sub>4</sub>, which is released during enteric fermentation (eructation in ruminants) and emitted from manure decomposition; 27% are in the form of CO
   <sub>2</sub> emitted during the production and transport of animal products and feed, and 29% are N
   <sub>2</sub>O attributable to manure and fertilizer [
   <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>]. There is a clear need to address the contribution that farming animals makes to global warming.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To combat climate change caused by animal agriculture, a number of mitigation strategies have been proposed, as well as policy options to implement such strategies [
   <a rid="B11-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-animals-05-00361">11</a>]. A theme that runs through this literature is greater efficiency of production, with the aim to achieve more output for a given level of resources used. As explained in the pivotal 2006 United Nations, Food and Agriculture (FAO) report, 
   <span class="italic">Livestock’s Long Shadow</span>:
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p>The most promising approach for reducing methane emissions from livestock is by improving the productivity and efficiency of livestock production, through better nutrition and genetics. Greater efficiency means that a larger portion of the energy in the animals’ feed is directed toward the creation of useful products (milk, meat, draught power), so that methane emissions per unit product are reduced. The trend towards high performing animals and towards monogastrics and poultry in particular, are valuable in this context as they reduce methane per unit of product. The increase in production efficiency also leads to a reduction in the size of the herd required to produce a given level of product. Because many developing countries are striving to increase production from ruminant animals (primarily milk and meat), improvements in production efficiency are urgently needed for these goals to be realized without increasing herd sizes and corresponding methane emissions.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, by far, the most substantial emissions reductions can come through adaptations in current systems rather than requiring a shift to industrialized systems [
   <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>]. This is important from an animal welfare perspective. While there can be negative animal welfare impacts in all production systems, industrialized production has inherently problematic effects on billions of animals globally. Thus, it is important that there is significant alignment in both animal welfare and climate goals. Some ways in which they are less compatible are discussed in
