 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Proposals for climate change mitigation strategies often use the term, “sustainable intensification.” Yet, societal norms related to the way we treat animals and use them in agriculture are changing and some past practices are no longer as widely accepted. Intensification of animal farming may not ever truly be sustainable, unless, among other things, there is concomitant attention to the health and behavioral needs of the animals, a meaningful effort to provide them with a life worth living. There is an urgent need to integrate these other sustainability measures into GHG mitigation assessments [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While multiple approaches are necessary to help stop anthropogenic climate change, those that offer the largest potential climate and sustainability benefits, while avoiding negative tradeoffs, should be the focus. This could mean different approaches (and levels of focus) for pre-market (production side) 
  <span class="italic">versus</span> the market and beyond (demand side). For example, with production-side measures, there can be a rapid marginalization of further climate benefits beyond initial productivity gains [
  <a rid="B159-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B159-animals-05-00361">159</a>]. Demand-side approaches, on the other hand, seem to offer a largely untapped potential with multiple co-benefits.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More research is needed to explore the combination of animal welfare and environmental improvements. There are some promising examples in pigs [
  <a rid="B222-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B222-animals-05-00361">222</a>], chickens [
  <a rid="B223-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B223-animals-05-00361">223</a>], and dairy cows [
  <a rid="B224-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B224-animals-05-00361">224</a>,
  <a rid="B225-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B225-animals-05-00361">225</a>]. These studies exhibit potential and the factors dictating these results, as well as ways to improve upon them, should be the focus of future research agendas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Calls to globalize the production systems that were developed in the West are concerning when the impacts on the animals are taken into account, and there is worldwide momentum toward abandoning the worst practices. For example, multinational corporations such as McDonalds, Compass Group, and Nestle are asking producers for plans to eliminate gestation crates from their supply chains. Legislative and voluntary phase-outs of intensive animal confinement systems are increasingly taking hold across the globe, for example in the European Union, South Africa, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and several US states, with active campaigns in many additional regions of the world. The global movement toward farm animal welfare reform must be an important consideration going forward in the discussion of climate change mitigation strategies, and research and policy should increasingly reflect this.</p>
