 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study is the first large-scale quantitative attempt to assess the impact of climate change on health of the vulnerable communities in Bangladesh (
  <a rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0027">27</a>). Similar studies have been conducted in Philippines (
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">28</a>), Vietnam (
  <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">29</a>), the United States of America, Canada, Malta (
  <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">30</a>), Nigeria (
  <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">31</a>), Nepal (
  <a rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0032">32</a>), India (
  <a rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0033">33</a>), Australia (
  <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">34</a>), and China (
  <a rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0035">35</a>), although their main focus was on people's perception about the impact of climate change on health. A cross-sectional study of two villages in Bangladesh had some limitations with regard to generalizability but their findings on climate-related health coping supports some of the findings of our study (
  <a rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0026">26</a>). The average total health expenditure was more in our study (6,555 BDT) when compared with the study by Haque et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0017">17</a>) (2,250 BDT). Our sample size was larger, representative, and geographically more well-distributed among vulnerable communities when compared with studies in other developing countries, such as Nepal and Trinidad and Tobago (
  <a rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0036">36</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0037">37</a>). This survey revealed that the vulnerable community believes that the climate is changing with an effect on human health in Bangladesh. This information is supported by the BMD data from 1951 to 2011, SAARC Meteorological Research Centre (SMRC), and other studies (
  <a rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0038">38</a>–
  <a rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0044">44</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study finding showed that almost half of the families (approximately 9 million people in the coastal catchment) became homeless and displaced for a long time due to extreme weather events such as floods, cyclones, and so on, with a mean of 38 days. Almost one-third of the families experienced displacement twice in a span of 10 years. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011 (
  <a rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0045">45</a>). Norman Myers, a British environmentalist, predicted that, in 2050, 15 million people will be displaced in Bangladesh (
  <a rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0046">46</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This survey has focused some light on the recent initiative of the Bangladesh government (2009) to decentralize health care facilities up to the village level through community clinics (for every 6,000 of the rural population). There are four tiers of health care service delivery in the government setup of Bangladesh: community clinics (6,000 rural population at the village level), Union Health and Family Welfare Centres (at the union level), Upazila health complex (50-bedded hospitals at the sub-district level), district hospitals (100–250 bedded) and tertiary-level hospitals (medical colleges and specialized hospitals). We tried to explore which facilities were most accessible to the vulnerable community and to what extent. We also explored the services obtained from unqualified service providers. This is not directly related to climate change but there is an indirect correlation. During extreme weather events (such as floods) the communication is disrupted and accessibility is hampered (
  <a rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0026">26</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual total health expenditure estimate of all households was tremendous (approximately 44 million BDT) and coming from OOP of the low-income climate vulnerable group (
  <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">47</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0048">48</a>), which was even higher than the estimate of Bangladesh National Health Accounts (BNHA) 1997–2012 (
  <a rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0049">49</a>). This could be useful for the Health Economics Unit (HEU) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) to calculate the direct health expenditure of the climate-vulnerable communities of Bangladesh in NHA.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study area was outside of the current endemic districts of malaria; still 295 self-reported cases of malaria were found in the non-endemic areas. This finding supports the prediction of the ‘Second National Communication of Bangladesh to the UNFCCC’ that the malaria-affected areas will increase in future and some new areas will be exposed to it (
  <a rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0050">50</a>). The number of deaths from drowning and snake bites corroborates with other community-based studies in Bangladesh (
  <a rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0051">51</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0052">52</a>). During extreme weather events, such as floods and cyclones, the normal habitat of snakes are lost and they come out in the community which accounts for the increased number of snake bites. So, there is again an indirect relationship of the increased number of extreme events with that of the increased number of snakebites and drowning cases as well.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our study, participants strongly agreed that agricultural food crop production had reduced from 10 years back. Nutritional status is affected by food crop production and there might be a correlation with climatic variability which needs to be explored by further study (
  <a rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0053">53</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0054">54</a>). As most of the respondents were agro-based by occupation (mostly farmers), this is a general observation from their field experiences. We did not explore the link of climate change in this study, but the impact on nutrition (as from the BMI) could be explored in future by linking these information. The nutritional status showed that almost half of the respondents were beyond normal weight. This finding is important for local-level planning and may help policy makers to develop and implement effective adaptation measures.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding childhood diarrhoea, our study is supported by the findings of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDRB) Matlab 2000–2006 study (
  <a rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0024">24</a>). The Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) shows 5% of diarrhoea and 6% of pneumonia (Acute Respiratory Illness, ARI) 2 weeks preceding the survey in 2011, respectively (
  <a rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0055">55</a>). A direct comparison of disease incidence by month and season with the 2011 DHS is complicated because of location effect of primary sampling units. Our study was conducted at highly vulnerable locations and during the post-monsoon season. That might be the cause of the high incidence rate of diarrhoea and pneumonia in children aged under 5 years. ICDDRB studies reported that climate variability is strongly linked with the incidence of childhood illnesses and that the impact of climate varies by season and location (
  <a rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0056">56</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0057">57</a>). One study showed that, in tropical and subtropical regions, high precipitation may cause the outbreak of diarrhoea (
  <a rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0058">58</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were a few limitations to this study, including the recall bias, as we relied on the previous experiences and subjective judgements of the head of the households. However, a similar approach was adopted in several other studies (
  <a rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0010">10</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0032">32</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">34</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0059">59</a>). Self-reported vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue were not confirmed with the support of laboratory reports; self-reported diseases might not be the same as physician-based diagnoses. Such data could be collected in future and compared for assessment of the accuracy of community perceptions. As 92.9% of participants were male, this could be an important limitation with regard to female evaluation of climate–health links. However, in the Bangladeshi context, as in the rest of South-East Asia, males are predominantly ‘the head of the household’ and females often provide household information through their male partners.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strengths of the study, however, outweigh the few limitations. The study recruited participants from an array of geographic locations known for their vulnerability to climate change. A large number of resource-poor rural households along the coast line and other vulnerable areas had been surveyed. This makes the findings from this study relevant to other climate-vulnerable areas of Bangladesh and South-East Asia as well (Ganges delta). A further strength is the collection of data from local community context with primary experiences of extreme weather events. The findings will provide strategic directions for sectoral policy implication of Health Population and Nutritional Sector Development Programme (HPNSDP) of Bangladesh. In addition, this study will be useful to formulate Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) activities at individual and community level for adaptation to health. The findings could be used as a baseline for a future cohort study.</p>
