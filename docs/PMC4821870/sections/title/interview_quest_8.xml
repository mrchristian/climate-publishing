 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to socio-demographic variables (family size, education, occupation, source of drinking water, total family income, duration of stay, etc.) and climate-related variables, we collected household data on malaria, dengue, pneumonia, and diarrhoeal diseases from every member of the household. Height and weight of the respondents were measured to obtain body mass index (BMI) for nutritional assessment. Other relevant information on primary health care facilities, school health promotion, and health system response were also collected through face to face interview.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dengue and malaria were self-reported by survey participants with a review of written history of diagnosis by a general practitioner or village doctor. In extreme weather events (flood, cyclone, storm surge, and drought), snakes lose their normal habitat and come out from their hideouts and move towards the households. Therefore, incidence of morbidity and mortality from snake bites increases during extreme weather events. We have compared our findings with the national-level household survey data of snake bites. The number of snake bites received by any household member for the past 12 months was recorded. Death from drowning increases during flood, cyclone, storm surge, and so on, which are related to extreme weather events. Mortality from drowning and snake bites is an important health indicator during extreme weather events. The number of deaths from drowning and snake bites during extreme weather events was quantified for the past 10 years preceding the interview. Household incidence of diarrhoea and pneumonia in children aged under-5 years was collected as number of episodes (at least one) for the last 12 months and for the last 1 month preceding the interview date. One episode of diarrhoea was defined as acute watery stool passed more than three times in 24 h or diagnosed by a registered physician. One episode of pneumonia (acute respiratory illness) was defined as fever, running nose, and/or cough, with shortness of breath and increased respirations (in drawing of ribs on observation) or diagnosed by a registered physician.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the diseases, respondents were asked about total family membersâ€™ outcome inclusive of his/her own. Female members of the family contributed to the response by reporting children's disease outcomes.</p>
