 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous research has suggested that perceptions of the scientific consensus play an important role in the formation of public beliefs and attitudes towards climate change and, moreover, that (mis)perceptions of the scientific consensus potentially decrease public support for climate change policies [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref015">15</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref019">19</a>]. This study constructively builds upon and extends this research by providing direct experimental evidence for the “gateway belief model” (GBM). Using pre and post measures from a national message test experiment, we found that all stated hypotheses were confirmed; 
  <span class="italic">increasing</span> public perceptions of the scientific consensus causes a significant increase in the belief that climate change is (a) happening, (b) human-caused and (c) a worrisome problem. In turn, changes in these key beliefs lead to increased support for public action. In sum, these findings provide the strongest evidence to date that public understanding of the scientific consensus is consequential.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to note that the gateway belief model (GBM) describes a two-step cascading effect. First, the effect of consensus messaging on key beliefs about climate change is fully mediated by the perceived level of scientific agreement. Second, the effect of the induced increase in perceived scientific consensus is fully mediated onto support for public action via the key beliefs about climate change. In other words, belief in the scientific consensus functions as an initial “gateway” to changes in key beliefs about climate change, which in turn, influence support for public action. Thus, consistent with other recent research, this study found that when in doubt about scientific facts, people are likely to use consensus among domain experts as a heuristic to guide their beliefs and behavior [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref015">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These findings have important practical implications for science communication and stand in direct juxtaposition to the claim that “consensus-messaging” is not effective as a communication strategy [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref013">13</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref014">14</a>]. In particular, it is sometimes argued that (a) despite past public communication efforts, public understanding of the scientific consensus has not changed much in the last decade and hence the approach must not be very effective (i.e., “the stasis argument”) [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref013">13</a>] and (b) because people are predisposed to engage in protective motivated reasoning (i.e., people process information consistent with their ideological worldviews), consensus-messaging is likely to be unsuccessful or could even backfire [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref014">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study finds no support for these claims. On the contrary, results of this study show that perceived scientific consensus acts as a key gateway belief for both Democrats and Republicans. In fact, the consensus message had a larger influence on Republican respondents. It should be noted that this interaction might, to some extent, be attributable to a ceiling effect (i.e., there is relatively less upward adjustment potential in perceived scientific consensus for Democrats, although a significant gap in understanding persists even among Democrats). We do not dispute, however, that some people—especially those with strong ideological responses to the issue—selectively process information or engage in motivated reasoning [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref009">9</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref014">14</a>]. Yet, we find that consensus-messaging does not increase political polarization on the issue (perhaps partly due to the neutral scientific character of the message) and shifts the opinions of both Democrats and Republicans in directions consistent with the conclusions of climate science.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, other recent research [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref024">24</a>] has suggested that past campaigns have been unsuccessful (in both their reach and exposure), given that a substantial lack of awareness of the scientific consensus still persists (“information deficit”) while at the same time, the spread of misinformation has vastly increased (“misinformation surplus”). Because people often encounter multiple and conflicting informational cues, the criticism might be raised that as a controlled experiment, this study may overstate the actual effect that consensus messaging would have in the real-world. While we agree with this view and see this as an important and open area for future research, this shortcoming does not, however, negate the structural validity of the GBM’s causal mechanisms. It is also important to note that this study only used a single treatment, yet found that even a single, simple description of the scientific consensus significantly shifted public perceptions of the consensus and subsequent climate change beliefs and desire for action. A concerted campaign to inform the public about the scientific consensus would ideally involve numerous exposures to the key message, conveyed by a variety of trusted messengers [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref006">6</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref020">20</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is important because by strategically sowing seeds of doubt, organized opponents of climate change action have continually tried to undermine the validity of the scientific consensus argument [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref011">11</a>]. As this research shows, such attempts could potentially decrease public engagement with climate change. Nonetheless, the present research also indicates the potential efficacy of consensus-messaging campaigns in mitigating such skepticism, as well as in generating support for public action on climate change. Particularly, repeated exposure to simple messages that correctly state the actual scientific consensus on human-caused climate change is a strategy likely to help counter the concerted efforts to misinform the public. Effectively communicating the scientific consensus can also help move the issue of climate change forward on the public policy agenda [
