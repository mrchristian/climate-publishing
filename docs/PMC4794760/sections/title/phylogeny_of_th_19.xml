 <div class="title">Phylogeny of the studied lineage obtained and reconstruction of the temperature change.</div>
 <p>Reconstructions were done using (
  <span class="bold">a</span>) the current temperature of the localities; (
  <span class="bold">b</span>) the estimated temperatures during the Last Glacial Maximum; and (
  <span class="bold">c</span>) the maximum historical range of temperature (Last Inter Glacial-Last Glacial Maximum) experienced in each of the caves. Horizontal axes, time before present (Ma). The position of 
  <span class="italic">Trapezodirus orobios, Speonomus longicornis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. fagniezi</span> Jeannel was indicated by green, red and blue squares, respectively. See 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</a> for details of the phylogeny.
