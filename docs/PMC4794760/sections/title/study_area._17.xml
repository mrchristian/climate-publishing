  <span class="bold">a</span>) Points mark the placement of caves with known populations of any of the species of the studied lineage. In yellow, areas with karstic substratum, i.e. suitable to have deep subterranean environment. In red, caves with predicted suitable current conditions when the thermal niche of the species was estimated from the LGM temperatures (

  <span class="bold">c</span>) and A2 (
