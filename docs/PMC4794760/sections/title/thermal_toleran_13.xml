  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. Among others, they conducted experiments of survival at different temperatures for up to 7 days for three of the species of this same clade. They used species under different thermal conditions since the Pliocene occupying the environmental range of the clade. They showed that both the Pyrenean and coastal species of the lineage seemed to be able to stand temperatures between approximately 1–20 °C, but in all cases they did not survive more than 48 h at 23 °C
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. In short term experiments, the lower thermal limit (supercooling) was found to be ca. −2.5 °C, close to the estimated freezing temperature of hemolymph in the absence of cryoprotectants.
