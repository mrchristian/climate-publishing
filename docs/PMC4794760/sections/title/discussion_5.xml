 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When we predicted the fate of the studied subterranean species under a global change scenario using their current distribution to estimate their thermal niche, results were dramatic. Most areas with predicted suitable temperatures fall outside their current distribution, and given the low mobility of the species, dispersal to other areas seems unlikely. These results are comparable to those obtained in most of the studies using similar methodologies, which predict large geographic displacements and widespread extinctions

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2</a>4. It has been argued that species could stand the predicted change in place through adjustments in microhabitat use, phenology or behaviour
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2</a>5, but in our case, although minimal variation in humidity or airflow could affect in some degree the distribution of fauna within the cave, the possibility of these adjustments is very limited due to the general homogeneity of their environments. However, we show that the use of thermal niches estimated from LGM climatic conditions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2c,g</a>) failed to predict the response to past climate changes, as only 4% of the populations of the LGM were expected to maintain suitable conditions through the Holocene (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>) - which obviously was not the case. From our results it can be confidently concluded that in this group species maintained their ranges through the last glacial cycle, given the impossibility to track optimal climatic conditions by dispersing to areas with suitable temperatures. It is thus clear that based only on current conditions it is not possible to predict the fate of this clade of subterranean species in front of predicted global change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If species have difficulties in tracking their optimal temperatures and cannot exploit habitat heterogeneities, they may adapt to the new conditions through the evolution of their thermal tolerances
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2</a>6. However, our results suggest that to survive 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> the projected changes in climatic conditions subterranean species would require rates of climatic niche evolution that are largely unprecedented in their evolutionary history. Similar results were found in a recent study
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a> using 17 clades of terrestrial vertebrates, although in this case only sister species were considered and thus the estimated changes were restricted to the most recent cladogenetic events. We applied a phylogenetic method to reconstruct temperature changes without any internal constraints other than the evolutionary model used, which means that we minimised the global amount of change through the evolutionary history of the lineage. It could be possible to envisage alternative scenarios with an unequal distribution of change, which could be concentrated on some branches thus increasing the maximum estimated rates. But this would also require that a high proportion of the species were able to closely track their optimal temperatures to minimise change even further, which seems highly unlikely given our results. In any case, differences in estimated past and future rates of change were of such magnitude that accounting for potential evolution did not improve the predicted demise of these species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To reconstruct the temperatures during the LGM we used a global model
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>, with an estimated age of 21 ka BP. However, the growing consensus is that the glacial maximum (defined as the maximum extent of the ice cover) occurred earlier in the Iberian Peninsula than in the rest of Europe, at ca. 50 ka BP
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>. This should not affect our conclusions, as the estimated absolute range of temperature differences remains the same and the increase in the transition time between glacial and interglacial can only lower the rates of change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a direct consequence of the stability of the subterranean environment, the reconstructed minimum change of thermal tolerance experienced by the studied lineage through their evolutionary history (approximately ±5 °C) was surprisingly low. Even so, this may have been enough to cope with climate change in the last ca. 18 MY. If species maintained a window of thermal tolerance, or a range of phenotypic plasticity, wider than these ±5 °C, a possibility is that they did not experience the need to adjust to climatic changes. Thermal tolerance experiments with some of the species of the studied lineage suggest that this may be the case
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. The upper limit of this range (20 °C) would be above the maximum temperatures that any of the species of the clade may have experienced since the Miocene. This lack of adjustment to local temperature was interpreted as a result of the loss of costly regulatory mechanisms due to the extreme conditions of the deep subterranean environment
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that for species with poor dispersal capabilities, and even under optimal circumstances minimising the uncertainties of bioclimatic models, only an experimental approach combined with data on species biology
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">14</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2</a>9 can provide strong evidence of the capability of species to cope with temperatures outside those of their current environment. In the case of the studied lineage of exclusive deep subterranean species, we can say that most species will be exposed to climatic conditions and rates of change unprecedented in their evolutionary history, but that in most cases temperatures will still be within their fundamental niche due to the lack of adjustment to local conditions. However, this lack of adjustment also means that for those species already close to the upper limit of their fundamental niches (i.e. those with the lower Thermal Safety Margins; TSM) the possibilities of survival are severely limited. To what extent this is a general situation or just a peculiarity of subterranean species is not known, as physiological data is still available for only a very limited number of species and the possibility of behavioural or phenological adjustments is usually not considered.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species living in the warmer areas close to the coast seem to be most vulnerable, as temperature for these areas is predicted to be around 20 °C in 2080 (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</a>). This is close to the estimated upper limit of their fundamental climatic niche
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a> thus limiting their thermal safety margin. In general, conservation recommendations related to climate change are mostly strategies based on the selection of protected areas and measures to increase habitat connectivity
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>. However, for cave species, as happens for other species with poor dispersal capabilities, the concentration of conservation efforts in actual localities (i.e., 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> management) could be a more efficient and practical strategy. Although these measures are recommended for species living in the central Pyrenees (i.e. those with wider TSM), they seem insufficient for species and populations highly vulnerable to climatic change, such as those living in the coast. At present it is not know whether the situation of the coastal species of 
  <span class="italic">Troglocharinus</span> is common among the subterranean fauna or a unique situation consequence of their peculiar evolutionary history
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>. Despite the long fascination by the peculiarities of typical subterranean organisms
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a> there is a general lack of knowledge of most subterranean groups worldwide. Subterranean biodiversity has been largely neglected in conservation programs worldwide, even if it has been estimated a total of 50,000–100,000 obligate subterranean species
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>, with a high level of local endemism
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that assessments of global warming impacts for poor dispersal species based only on bioclimatic models could result in significant prediction errors, perhaps underestimating the persistence of species 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> and overestimating their potential to access and exploit predicted future climate space
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">7</a>,8,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">3</a>8. These same approaches have been applied to many species with narrow distribution for which dispersal ability or thermal tolerance are not known resulting in some cases in alarming predictions. To deal with these uncertainties, a new, integrated science of climate-change biodiversity assessment is emerging based on multiple sources and approaches
