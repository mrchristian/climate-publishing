 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We focused on a well-defined clade of troglobitic beetles of the tribe Leptodirini (Coleoptera, Leiodidae) living in the North-eastern Iberian Peninsula (from the Pyrenees to the coast of Catalonia; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>), including 85 species (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S1</a>). Note that we defined our “species” as monophyletic units, which in some cases include lineages within non monophyletic species, subspecies or more than one species when one of them occurs in a single cave to increase the sample size for modelling purposes (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S1</a>). The studied clade was reconstructed to have a highly modified life cycle
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a> and all species have the typical troglobitic morphological characters (i.e. they are blind, apterous, depigmented and with elongated appendages)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a>. Most of them are narrow endemic species with a well-known distribution

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each of the taxa we compiled georeferenced distributional data from our own records, specialized publications and other unpublished information to estimate the extremes of the climatic conditions within their entire ranges. To characterise current thermal niches we used the mean annual temperature from the entire study area at 0.08 degree spatial resolution cells from WORLDCLIM version 1.3 (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To compute the bioclimatic models, we first estimated for each species the temperature in the observed presence localities (i.e. the estimated temperature of the cave), and then calculated the extreme climatic values for their whole range. Then, assuming that temperature is the most important factor to characterise their climatic niche and that these recorded occurrences are representative of the full climatic conditions in which the species may survive and reproduce, we used these extreme values to derive a distributional hypothesis on the areas with climatically (thermal) suitable conditions (considered here as the potential distribution)
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">7</a>. Basically, all grid cells with climatic values falling within the mentioned range were designated as suitable, and all cells outside it as unsuitable. We use this “bioclimatic envelope” procedure to be conservative, as it is an established procedure directed at maximizing the capacity to represent geographically the potential distribution of species niches when they are only based on distributional data

DNA extractions of single specimens were non-destructive, using either a phenol–chloroform method or commercial kits (mostly DNeasy Tissue Kit, Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We aligned length variable (i.e. ribosomal) sequences with MAFFT v. 7 and the Q-INS-i algorithm, which considers the secondary structure
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">45</a>. To obtain an ultrametric tree we used BEAST v.1.7
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">46</a> with an uncorrelated lognormal clock and a Yule speciation process. We linked the evolutionary rates of the mitochondrial protein coding genes and the two nuclear ribosomal genes respectively to reduce the number of free parameters, and used a GTR + I + G model with unlinked parameters for each partition. Trees were rooted in the node separating a clade with 1 instar larval development from a clade with either 2- or 1-instar, according to the topology of a previous study
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a> (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</a>). For the calibration we used the estimates obtained in this same study, that were based on the tectonic separation of the Sardinian plate, 16.6 Ma for the clade of species with a 1-instar cycle and 13.7 Ma for the clade of uncertain life cycle type. Both were set up as priors with a normal distribution with the estimated age as mean and a standard deviation of 1 MY.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the estimation of the minimum accumulated change in temperature experienced through the evolutionary history of the lineage, we used ancestral trait reconstruction in BEAST, using as a quantitative trait the temperature of the cave in which each specimen was found (either directly measured or inferred from the annual average temperature of the locality; see 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Tables S2</a> and 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S3</a>), and a multivariate diffusion model of evolution. We used three different measures: current temperature, the estimated LGM temperature, and the difference between the two (“range”) (see below). Analyses were run for 60 million generations, with a conservative burn-in of 10 millions. In all Bayesian analyses convergence was assessed with the effective sample size in TRACER 1.5. This reconstruction can be interpreted as the minimum amount of change in the thermal niche that the species should have experienced through their evolutionary history given the observed differences between species and the reconstructed topology.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the minimum rates of thermal niche change that the species must have experienced we used three measures: i) average rate of thermal niche change, calculated as the average rate of all branches connecting all the specimens of each species with the root of the tree. For each branch, rate evolution was calculated as the absolute difference between the reconstructed initial and final temperatures divided by the length of the branch. ii) Maximum per-branch rate of thermal niche change, or the highest per-branch reconstructed rate among all the branches of the tree. iii) Adjusted LGM rate of change, calculated as the difference between the estimated paleotemperatures of the areas occupied by the species during the LGM (21,000 YBP) and the current temperatures. This range was estimated according to our conclusion that the species experienced this variation

They used species under different thermal conditions since the Pliocene occupying the environmental range of the clade. They showed that both the Pyrenean and coastal species of the lineage seemed to be able to stand temperatures between approximately 1–20 °C, but in all cases they did not survive more than 48 h at 23 °C
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. In short term experiments, the lower thermal limit (supercooling) was found to be ca. −2.5 °C, close to the estimated freezing temperature of hemolymph in the absence of cryoprotectants.
