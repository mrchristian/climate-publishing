The final matrix for the phylogenetic analyses included a total of 122 specimens of 64 species in 18 genera (out of the 85 known

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Specimens were collected by direct search or with the use of baits and stored in absolute ethanol. DNA extractions of single specimens were non-destructive, using either a phenol–chloroform method or commercial kits (mostly DNeasy Tissue Kit, Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Vouchers are kept at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, Madrid (MNCN) and the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, Barcelona (IBE). We amplified and sequenced the same fragments as in a previous study
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>, i.e. seven genes totalling more than 4 Kb: five mitochondrial (cox1 –amplified in two fragments–, cob, rrnL, trnL, nad1 –the last three amplified in a continuous single fragment) and two nuclear (SSU, LSU). Primers and PCR conditions were the same as in a previous study
