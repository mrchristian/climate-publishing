 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean rate of minimum absolute temperature change across all the branches of the tree was 0.76 °C/MY. The species that experienced the overall fastest minimum rate of absolute thermal niche change when considering only current conditions was 
  <span class="italic">Trapezodirus orobios</span> (Fresneda, Hernando &amp; Lagar), with an average of 0.84 °C/MY (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). The branch of the tree with the highest absolute rate of thermal niche change was found in 
  <span class="italic">Speonomus longicornis</span> (Saulcy), with a rate of 3.62 °C/MY (from 9.42–8.2 °C in the last 0.33MY). The fastest rate of change when considering only a temperature increase was 2.28 °C/MY in a terminal branch of 
  <span class="italic">Speonomus fagniezi</span> Jeannel (from 10.9–12.9 °C in 0.87MY). When we considered the estimated LGM paleotemperatures of the areas currently occupied by the species, the maximum rate of thermal niche change was found in a population of 
  <span class="italic">Trapezodirus orobios</span>, from 4.4 °C to 10.4 °C in the 21,000 years since the estimation used for the LGM (i.e., 0.029 °C/100 years).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The IPCC estimated rates are 3–4 °C for mean annual temperature in the next ~100 years, depending on location (IPCC 2007). The minimum rate of change estimated among the species of the clade, even considering the constraint of Quaternary glaciations, was then between ~10,000 and ~100 times slower than the expected rate of change from 2000–2100.</p>
