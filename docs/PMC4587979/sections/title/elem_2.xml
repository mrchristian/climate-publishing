  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Public awareness of the terms climate change and global warming was identified using Google Trends (google.com/trends) and public databases of Google queries [
   <a rid="pone.0138996.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref037">37</a>]. To specify the exact searches we used the two terms ‘climate change’ and ‘global warming’ as query phrases. Queries were normalized using relative search volume (RSV) to the period with the highest proportion of searches going to the focal terms (i.e. RSV = 100 is the period with the highest proportion for queries within a category and RSV = 50 when 50% of that is the highest search proportion). Two assumptions were necessary for this study. The first is, of the two terms, climate change and global warming, that which draws more search results is considered more interesting to the general population. The second assumption is that changes in keyword search patterns are indicators of the use of different forms of terminology used by the public. To analyze sentiments related to climate change and global warming, tweets containing acronyms for climate change and global warming were collected from Twitter API for the period from October 12 to December 12, 2013. A total of 21,182 and 26,462 tweets referencing the terms climate change and global warming were collected respectively. When duplicated tweets were identified, they were removed from the analysis. The remaining tweets totaled 8,465 (climate change) and 8,263 (global warming) were compiled for the sentiment analysis.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Twitter® comments are emotionally loaded, due to their textually shortened nature. Sentiment analysis, which is in effect opinion mining, is how opinions in texts are assessed, along with how they are expressed in terms of positive, neutral or negative content [
   <a rid="pone.0138996.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref036">36</a>]. Nasukawa and Yi [
   <a rid="pone.0138996.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref010">10</a>]state that sentiment analysis identifies statements of sentiment and classifies those statements based on their polarity and strength along with their relationship to the topic.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sentiment analysis was conducted using Semantria® software (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.semantria.com" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.semantria.com</span>), which is available as an MS Excel spreadsheet application plugin. The plugin is broken into parts of speech (POS), the algorithm within the plugin then identifies sentiment-laden phrases and then scores them from -10 to 10 on a logarithmic scale, and finally the scores for each POS are tabulated to identify the final score for each phrase. The tweets are then via statistical inferences tagged with a numerical value from -2 to 2 and given a polarity, which is classified as positive, neutral or negative [
   <a rid="pone.0138996.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref036">36</a>]. Semantria®, the program utilized for this study, has been used since 2011 to perform sentiment analyses [
   <a rid="pone.0138996.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref007">7</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0138996.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref022">22</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the analysis, an identity column was added to the dataset to enable analysis of individual tweets with respect to sentiment. A basic sentiment analysis was conducted on the dataset using the Semantria® plugin. The plugin uses a cloud based corpus of words tagged with sentimental connotations to analyze the dataset. Through statistical inference, each tweet is tagged with a sentiment value from -2 to +2 and a polarity of (i) negative, (ii) neutral, or (iii) positive. Positive nature increases with increasing positive sentiment. The nature of the language POS assignation is dependent upon the algorithmic classification parameters defined by the Semantria® program. Determining polarity for each POS is achieved using the relationship between the words as well as the words themselves. By assigning negative values to specific negative phrases, it limits the use of non-specific negation processes in language; however, the program has been trained to assess non-specific linguistic negations in context.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A tweet term frequency dictionary was computed using the N-gram method from the corpus of climate change and global warming [
   <a rid="pone.0138996.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref038">38</a>]. We used a combination of unigrams and bigrams, which has been reported to be effective [
   <a rid="pone.0138996.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref039">39</a>]. Before using the N-gram method, typological symbols were removed using the open source code editor (i.e. Notepad) or Microsoft Words’ “Replace” function.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in RSV’s for the terms global warming and climate change for the investigation period were identified using a paired t-test. Pettitt and Mann-Kendall tests were used to identify changes in distribution, averages and the presence of trends within the weekly RSV’s. The Pettitt and MK tests, which assume a stepwise shift in the mean (a break point) and are sensitive to breaks in the middle of a time series, were applied to test for homogeneity in the data [
   <a rid="pone.0138996.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref040">40</a>]. Temporal trends within the time series were analyzed with Spearman’s non-parametric correlation analysis. A paired t-test and Spearman’s non-parametric correlation analysis were conducted using SPSS software (version 17.0 SPSS In corp. Chicago IL) and Pettitt and MK tests were conducted using XLSTAT (version 7.0).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the accuracy and reliability of the Sentiment analysis, a Pearson’s chi-square analysis was performed. This test identifies the difference ratio for each emotional response group, and then compares them to determine reliance and probability of interactions between the variables, in this case the terms global warming and climate change.</p>
