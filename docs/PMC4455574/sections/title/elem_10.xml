 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hotter, drier conditions are by no means the only change expected with global warming. However, they do play significant roles in terms of degraded air quality.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Higher surface temperatures combined with natural stagnation events can intensify evaporation from soils and evapotranspiration from plants. An increase in carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>) and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere provides just a little extra heat to a stagnation event, says Kevin E. Trenberth, a senior scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. “If you accumulate this extra heat over a week or month,” he says, “it dries things out more quickly.”
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once land becomes dried out, there is no more evaporative cooling of the land and moistening of the atmosphere, Trenberth explains. Evaporation is the atmosphere’s natural coolant, he says, and rainfall is nature’s cleanser, pulling pollutants out of the air. Without rain and evaporation, outdoor air becomes increasingly harmful to breathe for vulnerable people.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“This [danger] is particularly important in monsoon regions in places like India, where there is a distinct wet season—four months long—and then a long dry season,” Trenberth says. Large amounts of air pollutants can build up during the long dry season, and the air pollution itself prevents the sun from penetrating through to the surface, he explains. That shuts down evaporation, and when moisture doesn’t get into the atmosphere, air pollutants don’t rain out as they do in a normal cycle.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reduced evaporative cooling also increases the chances of heat waves, and as heat waves intensify, so do the risks of drought conditions and wildfires. Heat waves have become more frequent in some regions and are predicted to become much more common over larger geographic areas by the end of the twenty-first century.

  <sub>3</sub> levels, and drought-related forest fires that would ultimately cause an estimated 15,000 excess deaths in France alone.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These enhanced dry-and-hot spells favor the creation and dispersal of airborne particulate matter, which can exacerbate asthma, rhinosinusitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory tract infections. All these conditions are predicted to become more widespread with climate change.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Warmer temperatures are implicated in a different way with another air pollutant: pollen. Warmer average temperatures are already extending the length of the pollen season and the geographic range of some plant species.

  </a> For example, North American ragweed, notorious for its contribution to seasonal allergies, has already made inroads in Europe and is expected to spread further as cooler areas become more hospitable.

   <span class="sup">13</span>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pollen grains don’t exist long as discrete particles in the atmosphere. For instance, in times of high relative humidity, nitrogen dioxide and ground-level O
  <sub>3</sub> can interact with birch pollen to modify some of the pollen’s proteins.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ulrich Pöschl, a chemist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, is now investigating how quickly increased O
  <sub>3</sub> concentrations and humidity at ground level can modify birch-pollen proteins enough to cause a heightened allergic response. “Under clean and dry outdoor conditions, you have just a few percent of modified proteins occurring over a day,” says Poschl. “But with more O
  <sub>3</sub> and higher humidity, the protein reactions can be quite fast, modifying dozens of percent in a day.”

  <p>As a result of warmer surface temperatures, the atmosphere overall is becoming moister, especially above the ocean surface, because warmer air can hold more water vapor. Since the 1970s, there has been a 3.5% increase in global tropospheric water vapor associated with an average global surface temperature increase of about 0.5°C.
   <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">
    <span class="sup">3</span>
   </a> But more moisture doesn’t necessarily mean more precipitation. Increased atmospheric water vapor can enhance climate extremes at both ends of the spectrum, contributing to more severe intense storms in some areas and more severe droughts in others.

  <p>This enhanced activity can heighten the impact of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the natural phenomenon with the largest impact on weather extremes around the world. ENSO occurs every three to seven years when easterly trade winds fall off and air pressure over the central equatorial Pacific Ocean becomes lower overall. The result is deviations from normal sea surface temperatures—warmer during the El Niño phase of ENSO and cooler during the El Niña phase. These fluctuations alter the normal distributions of temperatures and precipitation across the world, increasing rainfall in some regions and sharply diminishing it in others.

  <p>For years scientists have studied whether climate change is altering the patterns of jet-stream winds and other global air-circulation patterns associated with ENSO. “Our estimates of changes in atmospheric circulation and the winds and so on from climate are relatively small,” says Kevin E. Trenberth, a senior scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. “These changes are probably within the ‘noise level’ of natural variability.” In other words, for the most part weather patterns continue as they have before, with naturally occurring droughts, storms, and pressure systems. </p>
  <p>What’s different, Trenberth says, is that the consequences of these weather patterns tend to be greater than they used to be, in part because of higher average temperatures in oceans and on land. And when an extreme in natural variability—such as an intense drought—arrives and synchronizes in the same direction as the global warming trend, the result is typically a record-breaking weather event.

  <p>In 2010 and 2011 Texas suffered severe drought and outbreaks of wildfires that were likely enhanced by the appearance of La Niña, which caused the jet stream to move farther north.

   </a> “We missed out on the normal complement of winter storms, and we ended up on the dry side of them,” says Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon. 
  </p>
  <p>The combination of a natural drought and La Niña drew moisture from the soil and helped establish a high-pressure system that parked over Texas. “When there is less soil moisture, you have higher temperatures,” says Nielsen-Gammon. This dryness, he explains, helps create high-pressure weather that enhances further drying in a positive feedback loop. </p>
