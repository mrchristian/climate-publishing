  <a rid="B50-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-12-08359">50</a>]. Decreases in drinking water quality can, in turn, lead to water-related disease [

  <a rid="B60-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60-ijerph-12-08359">60</a>] and the exacerbation of heat stress [
  <a rid="B61-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61-ijerph-12-08359">61</a>]. The pattern of reduced water levels, stream flow and resultant stagnation during drought can increase contaminant concentrations in ground and surface waters [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-08359">46</a>,
  <a rid="B51-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-12-08359">51</a>,
  <a rid="B62-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-12-08359">62</a>,
  <a rid="B63-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijerph-12-08359">63</a>]. For example, measurements taken during a drought in 2003 over the Rhine and Meuse rivers in Europe showed not only a substantial reduction in river discharge relative to the year before, but also that chloride concentrations were inversely related to the flow (m
  <span class="sup">3</span>/s) of these rivers [
  <a rid="B64-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijerph-12-08359">64</a>]. This effect is thought to increase when contaminants continue to be added to the system [
  <a rid="B64-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijerph-12-08359">64</a>]. Lower water levels can also facilitate an increase in reactions between the water, contaminants and sediments [
  <a rid="B62-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-12-08359">62</a>]. This can be further reinforced by greater soil erosion during drought [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-08359">23</a>]. In the U.S., elevated nitrate, orthophosphates, chlorides and sulfates in groundwater have also been associated with drought, in some cases exceeding the U.S. EPA’s Maximum Contaminant Level [
  <a rid="B63-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijerph-12-08359">63</a>]. Frequent detection in wells near agriculture and septic systems suggested these systems were at risk of contamination [
  <a rid="B63-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijerph-12-08359">63</a>]. Baures 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B65-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-ijerph-12-08359">65</a>] found that variation in total organic carbon and nitrate was associated with changes to river flow in France, with a high ratio of total organic carbon to nitrate concentrations under conditions of very low river flow. A UK study found that drought can lead to greater contamination of drinking water source water from dissolved organic carbons and can increase difficulty in contaminant removal [
  <a rid="B66-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66-ijerph-12-08359">66</a>]. Similar patterns have been reported in Canada. Elevated nutrient concentrations (
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, phosphorous and nitrogen) have been observed in association with low water periods in Alberta [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nutrient-loading is known to lead to eutrophication and is associated with cyanobacterial (algal) bloom development in all provinces [
  <a rid="B68-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-ijerph-12-08359">68</a>]. Some cyanobacteria produce toxins that are harmful to humans and blooms can impact water bodies used as sources of drinking water and for recreational water activities [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-08359">2</a>]. In Nebraska (U.S.), for example, drought was considered a contributing factor to a cyanobacteria bloom in 2004 that resulted in reports to public health of impacts such as gastrointestinal illness and the issuance of health alerts and advisories for nearly 100 lakes [
  <a rid="B69-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69-ijerph-12-08359">69</a>]. However, Barbeau 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B70-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70-ijerph-12-08359">70</a>] carried out a hypothetical analysis of the vulnerability of Quebec’s provincial drinking water systems to toxic cyanobacteria and their results suggest that existing systems in that province would be able to cope with this risk, even within the context of climate change. In Ontario, there was a significant increase in algal blooms between 1994 and 2009 [
  <a rid="B71-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71-ijerph-12-08359">71</a>]. Climate change may lead to changes in the frequency and duration of algal blooms, as well as increases in the amount of toxins they produce or an increase in the prevalence of toxin-producing species overall in temperate regions [
  <a rid="B70-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70-ijerph-12-08359">70</a>,
  <a rid="B71-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71-ijerph-12-08359">71</a>]. Warmer temperatures anticipated with climate change may promote algal blooms through mechanisms such as reducing the mixing of water, allowing algae to rise to the surface more quickly and by increasing the salinity of freshwater bodies [
  <a rid="B72-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72-ijerph-12-08359">72</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The warmer temperatures associated with drought and decreases in water flow and/or volume may promote the survival and growth of pathogens in water, including those responsible for infectious disease [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-08359">46</a>,
  <a rid="B55-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-12-08359">55</a>,
  <a rid="B73-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73-ijerph-12-08359">73</a>]. Reduced water flow can lead to an increase in bacterial concentration and reduced water quality as there is less water available to dilute these contaminants [
  <a rid="B64-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijerph-12-08359">64</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change-related impacts on water, including drought, are recognized as leading to greater risks from water-borne diseases such as hepatitis A [
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-12-08359">52</a>]. However, there appears to be limited discussion of the relationship between drought and water-borne pathogens and the interactions between climate change and water-borne diseases are complex. In the U.S., the survival and multiplication of bacteria leading to leptospirosis outbreaks may have been altered by temperature and pH changes resulting from the stagnation associated with drought [
  <a rid="B75-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75-ijerph-12-08359">75</a>]. Similarly, although 
  <span class="italic">Naegleria fowleri</span> is rare, increased water temperature during drought can allow for the amoeba to grow in greater concentrations [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-08359">46</a>]. Drought conditions may concentrate pathogens while at the same time inactivate them (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">Cryptosporidium</span> oocysts) [
  <a rid="B54-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-12-08359">54</a>]. In Canada, it is important to note that the greatest burden from enteric, food and water-borne diseases, drawing on 2012 data, is associated with 
  <span class="italic">campylobacteriosis</span> (10,174 cases), followed by salmonellosis (6828 cases) and giardiasis (3862 cases). Other reportable diseases in this category have a far smaller number of cases, such as shigellosis with 1,068 reported cases and approximately 500 cases each of 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> and cryptosporidiosis in 2012 [
  <a rid="B76-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-ijerph-12-08359">76</a>].In addition, while at its peak in 1970, there were 12,283 cases of hepatitis A reported in Canada; this has since fallen to approximately 200–300 cases per year [
  <a rid="B76-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-ijerph-12-08359">76</a>]. Future changes to the frequency and/or severity of drought could modify the burden associated with these diseases in Canada.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In coastal areas, drought can result in the contamination of groundwater drinking water sources by the intrusion of salt water [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-08359">46</a>,
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-12-08359">50</a>]. The mingling of saline and fresh groundwater that occurs in such regions can progress inland affecting freshwater wells, under a number of circumstances, including drier periods [
  <a rid="B77-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-12-08359">77</a>]. Saltwater intrusion can be exacerbated by climate change and sea-level rise [
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-12-08359">50</a>,
  <a rid="B77-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-12-08359">77</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combination of drought with extreme precipitation may also impact water-, food- and vector- borne diseases. The most commonly cited impact of climate change on water-borne disease is the anticipated effects of increasing frequencies and amounts of heavy rainfall impacting the likelihood that untreated and pathogen-carrying water is consumed by Canadians [
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-12-08359">52</a>]. Drought can amplify the impacts of a subsequent extreme rainfall event. During a drought event the soil can become compacted, thereby increasing runoff and the likelihood of water contamination and water-borne illness from precipitation events that follow [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-08359">46</a>,
  <a rid="B54-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-12-08359">54</a>,

  <a rid="B78-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78-ijerph-12-08359">78</a>]. Conditions associated with drought, such as low rainfall, can also concentrate 
  <span class="italic">Giardia</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Cryptosporidium</span> cysts in groundwater sources and where water is stored. Water sources may then be contaminated by the cysts after rainfall events [
  <a rid="B79-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79-ijerph-12-08359">79</a>]. Evidence from the Prairies suggests that the prevalence of livestock farming may affect water-borne diseases that follow such events if manure is able to contaminate water sources (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">Eschericia (E). coli</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Cryptosporidium</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Giardia</span>) [

  <span class="italic">Campylobacteriosis</span> outbreaks are also frequently associated with heavy rainfall, often when they follow a period of drought [
  <a rid="B54-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-12-08359">54</a>]. Although a much smaller risk for Canadians, with typically only 0–2 cases in Canada each year [
  <a rid="B76-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-ijerph-12-08359">76</a>], the pattern of drought conditions followed by a wet spring could also activate anthrax [
