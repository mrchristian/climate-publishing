 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent 2013 systematic review of the effectiveness of public health interventions to reduce the health impacts of climate change highlighted a gap in the literature around adaptation to drought [
  <a rid="B310-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B310-ijerph-12-08359">310</a>]. While there has been some effort to assess agricultural adaptation to drought [
  <a rid="B311-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B311-ijerph-12-08359">311</a>] and public health promotion activities that touch on related impacts, such as spinal cord injury [
  <a rid="B250-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B250-ijerph-12-08359">250</a>,
  <a rid="B251-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B251-ijerph-12-08359">251</a>], none of the public health adaptations specific to drought identified in the international literature had been evaluated. Here, again, a lack of specificity around drought among other climate change-related extreme weather events limits the relevance of these discussions for public health planning.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potential adaptations to directly or indirectly reduce health risks from drought are plentiful, particularly those that address agricultural impacts of climate change and weather variability. Few adaptations are discussed specifically in the context of drought but are often put forward to address secondary concerns (e.g., vector-borne diseases). Factors influencing agriculture and agricultural practices are complex and sometimes contradictory, ranging from public level issues driven by policy, legislation and international agreements, to environmental and community issues relating to how land is used and the local impacts [
  <a rid="B287-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B287-ijerph-12-08359">287</a>]. To a large extent adaptations to drought are emerging from regional risk and adaptation case studies [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is an opportunity to address multiple climate change-related health impacts under broad public health adaptations. In addition, adaptation activities and programs in other sectors can contribute co-benefits to the agricultural sector. Programs that have been developed for other objectives, such as protecting wildlife or water, have been found to provide incidental benefits to the agricultural sector during drought periods. Such co-benefits are not well recognized, but constitute just short of two-thirds of activities captured in a national inventory of programs for managing drought and agricultural water in Canada [
