 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive actions may be taken by individuals and professionals within primary care and community services settings to reduce the mental health impacts of drought. Personal hopefulness and positive attitudes towards the rural lifestyle have been highlighted as useful adaptations to drought [

  <a rid="B253-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B253-ijerph-12-08359">253</a>]. According to Caldwell and Boyd [
  <a rid="B254-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B254-ijerph-12-08359">254</a>] rural Australian families used a combination of both positive (e.g., problem-focused coping, optimism and positive appraisal) and less beneficial strategies (e.g., cognitive dissonance, denial and avoidance of negative social influences) in their response to drought. Primary care practitioners can provide support to reduce symptoms of mental illness exacerbated by drought and ineffective coping mechanisms such as substance abuse. They may also provide information about financial support resources or community drought support groups [

  <a rid="B255-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B255-ijerph-12-08359">255</a>]. Mental health programs in schools and in occupational settings and suicide prevention and awareness programs have also been identified as possible adaptation measures [

  <a rid="B257-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B257-ijerph-12-08359">257</a>]. Newspapers may be another pathway to communicate broadly about mental health during drought [
  <a rid="B258-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B258-ijerph-12-08359">258</a>].In Australia rural support workers help traditional mental health professionals identify farmers experiencing mental distress and refer them to support services [
  <a rid="B259-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B259-ijerph-12-08359">259</a>]. Training in mental health first aid can also increase the capacity of rural support workers to address mental health needs in drought-affected rural areas [
  <a rid="B260-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B260-ijerph-12-08359">260</a>]. One study suggested that the Rural Adversity Mental Health Program (RAMHP), which is based on a community development model, is effective in building capacity and resiliency to cope with the impacts of drought in rural New South Wales (Australia) [
  <a rid="B261-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B261-ijerph-12-08359">261</a>]. Linking the services and programs focused on mental health, community or social needs with those on practical assistance for farming communities is considered key for addressing mental health concerns associated with or exacerbated by drought [
  <a rid="B262-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B262-ijerph-12-08359">262</a>]. Access to support services for older individuals is another consideration [

  <a rid="B264-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B264-ijerph-12-08359">264</a>]. However, Australian farm families faced heavier workloads during the drought of 2002â€“2003, which left less time for community participation, volunteer activities and hence could negatively impact social capital and the community [
