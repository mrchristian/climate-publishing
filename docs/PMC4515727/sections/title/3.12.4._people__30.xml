 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individuals who spend more time outdoors have increased exposure to certain drought-related risks including those for respiratory diseases resulting from exposures related to wildfires and increased dust (e.g., dust-borne Valley fever) [

  <a rid="B146-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B146-ijerph-12-08359">146</a>]. Exposure to vector-borne diseases, such as WNV or Eastern Equine Encephalitis, that may be linked to drought is increased in people spending greater amounts of time outdoors for recreation and/or due to their occupation (e.g., agricultural workers, parks services), placing them at greater risk of contracting these diseases [

  <a rid="B76-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-ijerph-12-08359">76</a>]. Although the overall risk is considered to be low, individuals with greater exposure to the droppings of infected rodents are at increased risk of contracting rodent-borne diseases (e.g., Hantavirus) [

  <a rid="B75-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75-ijerph-12-08359">75</a>]. In addition to biological pathogens, they may also have greater exposure to chemical contaminants [
