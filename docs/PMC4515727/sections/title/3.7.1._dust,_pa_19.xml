 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drought is often accompanied by dry, dusty conditions and dust storms, which can impact health [

  <a rid="B153-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B153-ijerph-12-08359">153</a>]. Climate change can lead to an increase in fine particulate matter, allergen and dust concentrations in the air in drought-prone areas [
  <a rid="B154-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B154-ijerph-12-08359">154</a>] which can have significant health impacts. A study of a lake desiccated through persistent drought in Saskatchewan found a greater prevalence of coughing, wheezing and eye and nasal irritation among residents living near the lake than among those in a control group [

  <a rid="B156-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B156-ijerph-12-08359">156</a>] although dust storms were not associated with an increased risk of mortality [
