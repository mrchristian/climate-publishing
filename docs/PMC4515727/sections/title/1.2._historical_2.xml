 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Canada is considered a country with abundant water resources; however, these resources and the demands on them are distributed unevenly across the country [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-08359">12</a>] resulting in varied vulnerability to, and impacts from, drought. For example, 98% of the Canadian population resides in the South, which only provides 38% of the water yield (Water yield is the volume of freshwater resources for a defined geographic area and time period. It is an estimate of the amount of renewable water and non-renewable glacial melt) [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-08359">12</a>]. In the North, the per capita water yield is 98 times greater than in the South [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-08359">12</a>]. The water yield in the Prairies is a fraction (3%–12%) of that in the Great Lakes, Maritime Coastal or Pacific Coastal drainage regions and decreased between 1971 and 2004 [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 20th century, meteorological measurements have shown significant warming during all seasons but the greatest rates have been during winter and spring. They have also revealed general increases in precipitation, although considerable decadal-scale variability is present over many regions of the country. For example, Zhang 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-08359">13</a>] determined that mean annual air temperature has increased by an average of 0.9 °C over southern Canada between 1900 and 1998 with the greatest rates seen in the West during the winter and spring (southern Canada broadly refers to south of 60N; an exception is [
  <a rid="B314-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B314-ijerph-12-08359">314</a>] and mention in [
  <a rid="B315-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B315-ijerph-12-08359">315</a>] where southern Canada refers to south of 55N. See Figure 5 in [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-08359">4</a>] for additional details. For Statistics Canada discussions, see [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-08359">12</a>] for a description of standard drainage area classifications). Subsequent analysis extending the target period to 2010 confirmed the warming has continued and even accelerated with an increase in the mean annual temperature of 1.5°C for southern Canada over this longer period [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-12-08359">16</a>]. Zhang 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-08359">13</a>] also found that annual total precipitation increased significantly from 1990–1998 over most of southern Canada with the exception of southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. Analysis expanded to the period 1900 to 2009 also found an 8.7% increase in annual rainfall for southern Canada [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-08359">17</a>]. Snowfall mainly increased in northern Canada while at the same time decreasing significantly in the Southwest for the period 1950–2009 [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-08359">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An analysis of changes in extreme temperature indices over southern Canada from 1900–2003 and the entire country from 1950–2003 found that over most of the country, there was an increase in the number of warm days where the maximum temperature (&gt;90th percentile) and the number of warm summer days (maximum temperature &gt;25°C) during the last half century [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-12-08359">18</a>]. The number of hot days (&gt;30°C) and summer warm days (&gt;90th percentile) also increased over all of Canada, but were only significant in southwestern regions [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-12-08359">19</a>]. The analysis revealed little change in the number of summer warm spells. An examination of changes in extreme temperature and precipitation indices over southern Canada from 1900–2003 and the entire country from 1950–2003 found a decrease in the consecutive number of days with no measurable precipitation in British Columbia and Atlantic Canada. Trends in drought occurrence and severity in Canada are often monitored using meteorological drought indices, such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-08359">4</a>]. These indices are designed to assess regional precipitation anomalies (the SPI), or a region’s water balance using both precipitation and temperature data (PDSI and SPEI), to account for evapotranspiration effects. Results from trend investigations incorporating these various drought indices have shown variable results over Canada, often being dependent on the time period used in the trend calculation (mainly due to the aforementioned decadal-scale variability in precipitation). However, an increase in drought (i.e., a decreasing Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) trend) over most of the country was observed between 1950 and 2002 [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Western Canada, notably the southern Canadian Prairies and interior valleys of British Columbia, are more susceptible to drought because they lie in the lee of major mountain ranges and, as a result, generally receive little precipitation but with high variability [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-12-08359">20</a>]. During the past 100+ years, several long-duration droughts have occurred in western Canada. The Canadian Prairies have experienced large-area, multi-year dry episodes during the 1890s, 1930s, late 1950s/early 1960s, 1980s and more recently from 1999–2005 [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-12-08359">21</a>,
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-12-08359">22</a>]. During the notable drought period from 2001–2002, below average stream flows were reported across the country extending from western Canada to Ontario and the Atlantic Provinces [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-08359">23</a>]. Water levels of most closed-basin lakes have declined throughout the 20th century across southcentral Alberta and Saskatchewan in western Canada, although levels have increased in the past few years [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-12-08359">24</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Farther east, droughts do occur in southern Ontario and Quebec, although these events are usually shorter, smaller in area, less frequent and less intense [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-12-08359">20</a>]. Nonetheless, there have been major drought occurrences in the East during the last century [
  <a rid="B25-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-12-08359">25</a>] resulting in severe impacts, including low water levels in the Great Lakes [
  <a rid="B26-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-12-08359">26</a>]. Between 1920 and 1999, southern Ontario experienced major droughts in 1930, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1963, 1998, and 1999 [
  <a rid="B25-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-12-08359">25</a>]. Ontario was also impacted by drought in 2001–2002 [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-08359">23</a>]. Great Lakes’ water levels have shown considerable decadal-scale variability during the 20th century with no evidence of any long-term trend. However, lower Great Lakes’ water levels have coincided with the droughts of the 1930s, early 1960s and from early 2000 to the present [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-12-08359">20</a>].In 2011, water levels in the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Rivers system reached record low levels and some activities/sectors in Ontario watersheds were asked to reduce water consumption under the Ontario Low Water Response Plan (OLWR)[
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-08359">23</a>]. Déry 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B27-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-12-08359">27</a>] found that freshwater discharge rates decreased over a period of 37 years for the majority of key rivers feeding the Hudson, James and Ungava Bays. This watershed is fed by water from five provinces, the territory of Nunavut andfour U.S. states, covering an area that is equivalent to one-third of Canada [
  <a rid="B27-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-12-08359">27</a>]. Along the East Coast, droughts in the Atlantic provinces are infrequent. However, a side effect of their rarity is that these regions have lower adaptive capacity to deal with droughts, making the region more susceptible to drought impacts [
  <a rid="B28-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-12-08359">28</a>]. The Atlantic provinces were affected by the drought of 2001–2002, with river flows in the Atlantic Provinces dropping to a 20-year low [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-08359">23</a>]. An analysis of meteorological indices (southern Canada 1900–2003; entire country 1950–2003) indicated a decrease in the number of days with no measurable precipitation in Atlantic Canada [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-12-08359">18</a>]. The context surrounding this shift will be discussed further below.
