 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A broad range of adaptation strategies are available that help reduce the health impacts of drought. They generally attempt to reduce the impacts directly or they modify the environmental services or socioeconomic pathways through which drought affects health (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-08359-t002" href="#ijerph-12-08359-t002">Table 2</a>). However, there has been little evaluation of the effectiveness of many of these adaptations [
  <a rid="B183-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B183-ijerph-12-08359">183</a>,
  <a rid="B240-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B240-ijerph-12-08359">240</a>]. Limited knowledge of the effectiveness of current measures to reduce health risks from drought increases the possibility of “maladaptation” as communities and individuals prepare for climate change. Ensuring that adaptation strategies are developed with evidence-based information and through consultation with a wide range of partners mitigates the risk of maladaptation.
