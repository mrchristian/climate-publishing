 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agricultural workers and others who rely on water and/or rainfall for their livelihoods are at greater risk of experiencing the mental health impacts of drought [

  <a rid="B83-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83-ijerph-12-08359">83</a>]. Given their occupational environment, agricultural workers are at increased risk of “silo-filler’s disease” (NO

  <a rid="B158-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B158-ijerph-12-08359">158</a>]. Horticulturalists and people working for nurseries, garden supply stores and recreational facilities have also been identified as being at higher risk of negative health outcomes [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research in Australia suggests that drought-related stress on agricultural workers can be widespread. A survey of rural farmers in New South Wales, Australia found that 71.8% of rural farmers reported stress due to drought [
  <a rid="B213-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B213-ijerph-12-08359">213</a>]. Limited evidence suggests that drought is a contributing factor to suicide among men in rural areas [

  <a rid="B229-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B229-ijerph-12-08359">229</a>]. In some studies, younger farmers were found to experience higher levels of stress than their older counterparts between 55–64 years but not their oldest counterparts aged 65–74 years [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mental health impacts of drought can extend beyond farmers themselves to their families [
  <a rid="B237-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B237-ijerph-12-08359">237</a>]. Rural Australian youth have experienced negative mental health effects during prolonged drought [
  <a rid="B222-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B222-ijerph-12-08359">222</a>], with their emotional stress increasing with the length of the drought [
  <a rid="B217-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B217-ijerph-12-08359">217</a>]. Older women and Aboriginals have also been identified as being more vulnerable to these impacts [

  <a rid="B221-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B221-ijerph-12-08359">221</a>]. In general, rural and urban populations can experience different levels of drought-related distress. For drought that was both constant and long (although not for either alone) in Australia, distress levels in rural populations were observed to be higher relative to urban populations [
