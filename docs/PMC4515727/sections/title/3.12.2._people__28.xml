 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">People with chronic health conditions are at increased risk of health impacts associated with air quality compromised by drought including the effects of wildfires [

  <a rid="B155-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B155-ijerph-12-08359">155</a>]. This group is also thought to be at greater risk of drought-related infectious diseases [
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-12-08359">49</a>]. Pregnant and nursing women, dialysis patients and immune-compromised individuals are considered to be at increased risk from health impacts of drought and heat [
  <a rid="B47-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-12-08359">47</a>]. Pregnant women in their third trimester, diabetics and immunosuppressed individuals were thought to have increased risk of developing a disseminated case of Valley fever [
  <a rid="B238-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B238-ijerph-12-08359">238</a>]. Young children and seniors are at increased risk from drought-related water-borne diseases [
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-12-08359">49</a>]. In addition to the very young (particularly those who have received rotavirus vaccines) and the elderly, those who are immunocompromised are at greater risk of developing acute gastrointestinal illness from water-borne diseases [
  <a rid="B95-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95-ijerph-12-08359">95</a>]. Very young children and seniors overlap with those susceptible to heat as identified above and may also be at greater risk from decreases in water quality and availability [
  <a rid="B60-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60-ijerph-12-08359">60</a>]. Children under five years of age and adults over 50 years old are also at increased risk of developing a disseminated case of Valley fever [
  <a rid="B146-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B146-ijerph-12-08359">146</a>]. Individuals under institutional care (e.g., in hospitals, nursing homes) who depend on electrical equipment may be impacted by hydroelectricity power shortages during a drought [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-08359">46</a>]. Drought can also lead to disruptions of heating and cooling systems that rely on water to function, and these disruptions may result in health impacts on individuals when it is not possible to maintain health-protective temperatures [
