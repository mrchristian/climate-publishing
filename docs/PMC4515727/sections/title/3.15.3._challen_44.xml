 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measures taken to adapt to drought between 2000 and 2006 over the Canadian Prairies were expensive, their effectiveness varied and challenges were associated with their implementation [
  <a rid="B199-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B199-ijerph-12-08359">199</a>]. Gaps in knowledge and misplaced assumptions have been identified as obstacles to drought adaptation. A number of barriers to agricultural adaptation to drought were highlighted during the drought of 2001–2002 in Canada, including the lack of research and a lack of funds, as well as problems relating to institutions and processes [
  <a rid="B288-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B288-ijerph-12-08359">288</a>]. A study of water management systems in the North American Pacific Northwest found that water management decisions were centred around an assumption of stable conditions and this was compounded by a lack of access to regionally specific climate information [
  <a rid="B312-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B312-ijerph-12-08359">312</a>]. Challenges have also been noted in simply obtaining high quality local hydrologic information from climate change datasets [

  <a rid="B313-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B313-ijerph-12-08359">313</a>]. The paucity of such information makes it difficult for communities to develop more integrated climate adaptation plans which reduce drought risks.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Severe drought can exceed the adaptive capacity of agricultural producers and communities. In their analysis of the 2001–2002 Canadian drought, Wheaton 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B288-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B288-ijerph-12-08359">288</a>] found that some adaptations were ineffective and that drought brought about negative impacts even when adaptation measures were put in place. Drought can be a prolonged event, which also suggests the importance of considering both long-term and short-term adaptations and approaches to mitigate any long-term health impacts.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite rural areas having greater social capital than other parts of Canada [
  <a rid="B176-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B176-ijerph-12-08359">176</a>,
  <a rid="B264-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B264-ijerph-12-08359">264</a>], there is much reliance on technologies which may not be able to counter the full impacts of climate change on the production of key crops [
  <a rid="B178-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B178-ijerph-12-08359">178</a>]. Adaptations derived from new technologies will take time to understand, develop and institute (e.g., transgenics or traditional breeding for drought tolerance) [
  <a rid="B314-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B314-ijerph-12-08359">314</a>]. Furthermore, the resources required to generate necessary information about future climate and weather conditions and the required analyses may not be available to provide timely planning direction to farmers, municipalities and other local planners [
  <a rid="B286-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B286-ijerph-12-08359">286</a>,
  <a rid="B315-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B315-ijerph-12-08359">315</a>]. The literature reviewed in this paper highlighted that remote areas and communities may have significantly less adaptive capacity to reduce drought impacts than communities closer to urban centres.
