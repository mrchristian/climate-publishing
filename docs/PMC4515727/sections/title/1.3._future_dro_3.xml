 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All Global Climate Models (GCMs) project future increases of summer continental interior drying and associated risk of droughts. The greater overall risk is ascribed to further increases in temperature and resultant potential evapotranspiration not being offset by precipitation increases [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-12-08359">3</a>]. In fact, the recent Fifth Assessment Report from the IPCC [
  <a rid="B29-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-12-08359">29</a>] stated that an increase in the intensity and duration of future droughts on a regional to global scale is likely (
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, “medium” confidence) by the end of the 21st century. This statement especially applies to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, central Europe, central North America, Central America and Mexico, northeast Brazil, and southern Africa. Elsewhere there is overall “low” confidence because of inconsistent projections of drought changes (dependent both on the GCM model and dryness index). Definitional issues, lack of observational data, and the inability of models to include all the factors that influence droughts preclude stronger confidence than “medium” in drought projections (see [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some global studies have indicated that droughts will be slightly more frequent and longer in duration as compared to present-day conditions by the second half of the 21st century [
  <a rid="B31-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-12-08359">31</a>,
  <a rid="B32-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-12-08359">32</a>]. Specifically for North America, Trenberth [
  <a rid="B33-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-12-08359">33</a>], using several GCM simulations, showed that future warming will increase both evaporation and surface drying, thereby leading to longer and more intense drought particularly in the summer over continental interior regions of the continent. A recent study found that the southwest and central plains regions in the continental U.S. will be significantly drier by the end of the century when compared with historical periods. This was the case even across various GCMs, and different metrics of soil moisture in both moderate and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, future precipitation/water resource projections suggest that in Canada, the North will become wetter and the South drier especially in summer [
  <a rid="B35-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-12-08359">35</a>]. However, limited research has been carried out regarding potential future drought occurrence across Canada and most investigations have focused on the particularly drought-prone Canadian Prairies. A first-order assessment of future drought occurrence over southern Canada (2041–2070) by Bonsal and Regier [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-08359">14</a>] found future annual precipitation will increase over most of the southern region of Canada but this will be more than offset by increased temperatures that lead to higher evaporation so increases in drought are likely. The future mean PDSI estimates indicate the prevalence of more frequent drought for the southern half of the Canadian Prairies in the latter half of the 21stcentury with persistent negative PDSI values expected after 2040 [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-12-08359">15</a>]. This suggests the possibility of a regime shift to a more arid climate in the southern Prairies due to the effects of projected summer temperature increases. Future projections of PDSI also revealed that multi-year droughts lasting 10 or more years are more likely than what has been historically observed. Projections suggest approximately three such events per 100 years as compared to the approximately once every 100 years that has been observed. Similar results for the southern Canadian Prairies were also documented by PaiMazumder 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-12-08359">36</a>] using simulations from the Canadian Regional Climate Model for the period 2041–2070. Although published studies for the rest of Canada are limited, the authors noted that in more northern areas of the Prairies, drought events are projected to be less severe and less frequent. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to future precipitation events, particularly on a regional and intra-seasonal basis. Bonsal 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-12-08359">15</a>] found considerable range in projections in their assessment of changes to the temporal and spatial characteristics of future (2011–2100) PDSI and SPI using statistically downscaled daily temperature and precipitation data over the southern Canadian Prairies, from three GCMs with different greenhouse gas emission scenarios.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, although there are no comprehensive analyses of future drought events across all of Canada to provide detailed regional and seasonal drought information, both global investigations and a handful of studies conducted for the Canadian Prairies suggest that future droughts will likely increase, particularly in those regions that already experience these events (
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, more southern and interior areas of the country).
