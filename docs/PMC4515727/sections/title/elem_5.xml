   <a rid="B45-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-12-08359">45</a>], a broad range of public health impacts associated with drought has been identified in the U.S. [

    <a rid="B63-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijerph-12-08359">63</a>]. For example, measurements taken during a drought in 2003 over the Rhine and Meuse rivers in Europe showed not only a substantial reduction in river discharge relative to the year before, but also that chloride concentrations were inversely related to the flow (m

    <a rid="B64-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijerph-12-08359">64</a>]. This effect is thought to increase when contaminants continue to be added to the system [
    <a rid="B64-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijerph-12-08359">64</a>]. Lower water levels can also facilitate an increase in reactions between the water, contaminants and sediments [
    <a rid="B62-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-12-08359">62</a>]. This can be further reinforced by greater soil erosion during drought [
    <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-08359">23</a>]. In the U.S., elevated nitrate, orthophosphates, chlorides and sulfates in groundwater have also been associated with drought, in some cases exceeding the U.S. EPA’s Maximum Contaminant Level [
    <a rid="B63-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijerph-12-08359">63</a>]. Frequent detection in wells near agriculture and septic systems suggested these systems were at risk of contamination [

    <a rid="B65-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-ijerph-12-08359">65</a>] found that variation in total organic carbon and nitrate was associated with changes to river flow in France, with a high ratio of total organic carbon to nitrate concentrations under conditions of very low river flow. A UK study found that drought can lead to greater contamination of drinking water source water from dissolved organic carbons and can increase difficulty in contaminant removal [
    <a rid="B66-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66-ijerph-12-08359">66</a>]. Similar patterns have been reported in Canada. Elevated nutrient concentrations (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nutrient-loading is known to lead to eutrophication and is associated with cyanobacterial (algal) bloom development in all provinces [
    <a rid="B68-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-ijerph-12-08359">68</a>]. Some cyanobacteria produce toxins that are harmful to humans and blooms can impact water bodies used as sources of drinking water and for recreational water activities [
    <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-08359">2</a>]. In Nebraska (U.S.), for example, drought was considered a contributing factor to a cyanobacteria bloom in 2004 that resulted in reports to public health of impacts such as gastrointestinal illness and the issuance of health alerts and advisories for nearly 100 lakes [
    <a rid="B69-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69-ijerph-12-08359">69</a>]. However, Barbeau 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
    <a rid="B70-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70-ijerph-12-08359">70</a>] carried out a hypothetical analysis of the vulnerability of Quebec’s provincial drinking water systems to toxic cyanobacteria and their results suggest that existing systems in that province would be able to cope with this risk, even within the context of climate change. In Ontario, there was a significant increase in algal blooms between 1994 and 2009 [
    <a rid="B71-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71-ijerph-12-08359">71</a>]. Climate change may lead to changes in the frequency and duration of algal blooms, as well as increases in the amount of toxins they produce or an increase in the prevalence of toxin-producing species overall in temperate regions [
    <a rid="B70-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70-ijerph-12-08359">70</a>,
    <a rid="B71-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71-ijerph-12-08359">71</a>]. Warmer temperatures anticipated with climate change may promote algal blooms through mechanisms such as reducing the mixing of water, allowing algae to rise to the surface more quickly and by increasing the salinity of freshwater bodies [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change-related impacts on water, including drought, are recognized as leading to greater risks from water-borne diseases such as hepatitis A [
    <a rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-12-08359">52</a>]. However, there appears to be limited discussion of the relationship between drought and water-borne pathogens and the interactions between climate change and water-borne diseases are complex. In the U.S., the survival and multiplication of bacteria leading to leptospirosis outbreaks may have been altered by temperature and pH changes resulting from the stagnation associated with drought [
    <a rid="B75-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75-ijerph-12-08359">75</a>]. Similarly, although 
    <span class="italic">Naegleria fowleri</span> is rare, increased water temperature during drought can allow for the amoeba to grow in greater concentrations [
    <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-08359">46</a>]. Drought conditions may concentrate pathogens while at the same time inactivate them (e.g., 
    <span class="italic">Cryptosporidium</span> oocysts) [
    <a rid="B54-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-12-08359">54</a>]. In Canada, it is important to note that the greatest burden from enteric, food and water-borne diseases, drawing on 2012 data, is associated with 
    <span class="italic">campylobacteriosis</span> (10,174 cases), followed by salmonellosis (6828 cases) and giardiasis (3862 cases). Other reportable diseases in this category have a far smaller number of cases, such as shigellosis with 1,068 reported cases and approximately 500 cases each of 
    <span class="italic">E. coli</span> and cryptosporidiosis in 2012 [
    <a rid="B76-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-ijerph-12-08359">76</a>].In addition, while at its peak in 1970, there were 12,283 cases of hepatitis A reported in Canada; this has since fallen to approximately 200–300 cases per year [
    <a rid="B76-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-ijerph-12-08359">76</a>]. Future changes to the frequency and/or severity of drought could modify the burden associated with these diseases in Canada.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In coastal areas, drought can result in the contamination of groundwater drinking water sources by the intrusion of salt water [

    <a rid="B50-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-12-08359">50</a>]. The mingling of saline and fresh groundwater that occurs in such regions can progress inland affecting freshwater wells, under a number of circumstances, including drier periods [
    <a rid="B77-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-12-08359">77</a>]. Saltwater intrusion can be exacerbated by climate change and sea-level rise [

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combination of drought with extreme precipitation may also impact water-, food- and vector- borne diseases. The most commonly cited impact of climate change on water-borne disease is the anticipated effects of increasing frequencies and amounts of heavy rainfall impacting the likelihood that untreated and pathogen-carrying water is consumed by Canadians [
    <a rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-12-08359">52</a>]. Drought can amplify the impacts of a subsequent extreme rainfall event. During a drought event the soil can become compacted, thereby increasing runoff and the likelihood of water contamination and water-borne illness from precipitation events that follow [

    <span class="italic">Giardia</span> and 
    <span class="italic">Cryptosporidium</span> cysts in groundwater sources and where water is stored. Water sources may then be contaminated by the cysts after rainfall events [
    <a rid="B79-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79-ijerph-12-08359">79</a>]. Evidence from the Prairies suggests that the prevalence of livestock farming may affect water-borne diseases that follow such events if manure is able to contaminate water sources (e.g.,

    <a rid="B292-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B292-ijerph-12-08359">292</a>]. In 2001, partial allotments of 60% were successfully used to ensure the delivery of water supplies to all licensees.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water consumption can also be reduced by managing the timing of irrigation so that it targets the sensitive stages of crop development. In the case of corn, for example, yield losses may be reduced significantly by preventing water deficits at critical times in development; notably during the reproductive stages [

Even when plants are subjected to drought conditions, the timing and duration of the event must also be considered since plant processes can often recover following a period of drought if critical management actions are taken at the correct time (e.g., irrigation during flowering). Water conservation strategies and the timing and use of water (water management and irrigation timing) represent simple solutions that can be managed in response to need, when and where required (
    <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the farm scale). In contrast, technological and transgenic approaches will take time to develop [
    <a rid="B295-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B295-ijerph-12-08359">295</a>].

As such, farmers may need to balance trade-offs between production and the risk of drought in their choice of what to plant next season. Planting seeds representing a diversity of cultivar tolerance may prove beneficial in this case [
    <a rid="B299-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B299-ijerph-12-08359">299</a>]. The combined use of existing drought tolerant cultivars with physiologically sensitive timing of irrigation can serve to reduce water demands during key stages of development. Furthermore, since drought stressed plants and livestock are also more vulnerable to diseases, competition from invasive species and pests, strategies that increase genetic and crop diversity across fields and the landscape may represent adaptations that will provide overall benefits to both health and production [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Canada, drought resiliency in some rural and agricultural communities is related to proximity to urban centers. A study by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada [

Proximity to urban centers is thought to bring benefits related to off-farm incomes, access to technology (including computers/computing technologies), information networks (email, Internet) and access to agricultural institutions. Conversely, the lowest adaptive capacity was observed in areas more remote from urban centers, which were situated in more northern zones of this prairie belt. The importance of social networks and connectivity may be more obvious during periods of crisis, such as during the 2002 drought on the Prairies when farmers in eastern Canada who were less affected by drought shipped 64,000 bales of hay to western Canada through “Hay West” to support the worst struck areas [

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.15.1. Knowledge of Current and Future Drought Impacts on Health</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years information about the potential health impacts of drought has increased. Evidence pointing to health impacts that may be modified by climate change has continued to build since earlier reviews (e.g., by Smoyer-Tomic [
    <a rid="B51-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-12-08359">51</a>] in 2004). The number of Canadian-U.S. studies is increasing, with more than half of the records for this region published after 2004. However, Canadian studies continue to be focused on the Prairies. In addition to studies situated within the Canadian context broadly, more than half of the records identified focused specifically on western Canada and all but one targeted the Prairies specifically. Research linking mental health impacts with wildfire and drought has also expanded significantly. However, research around drought and health remains narrow. Approximately three-quarters of the primary international studies identified were focused on mental health and nearly all focus on Australia. In the Canadian-U.S. literature, more than one-third of the primary studies are focused on mosquito-borne disease, largely WNV and the related SLE. This also appears to be the area of current interest, with these records accounting for more than half of the primary Canadian-U.S. studies published after 2004. Limited data on actual health outcomes results in uncertainty about the severity or magnitude of these impacts. Consequently projections of climate change effects on drought-related health impacts remain difficult to make especially in the Canadian context.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the same time that more evidence is needed to understand the impact of drought on health outcomes, public health is challenged by the uncertainty surrounding the probable occurrence of future drought in Canada. There has been limited research directed toward the probability and assessment of future droughts specifically over Canada in the context of climate change and variability. Greater certainty around the characteristics of drought anticipated in the future and their linkages with specific health impacts could help adaptation planners better identify and prepare for key risks in their regions, including those related to human health. For example, the literature reviewed in this paper suggests that certain features of drought (e.g., subsequent heavy rainfall events) may significantly increase risks of some infectious diseases among Canadians. Knowledge of geographic areas likely to be affected by drought, as well as potential changes to frequency, duration and severity of events is critical for the development of adaptation strategies which can directly or indirectly reduce health impacts. Coordinated drought research is limited and fragmented in Canada, often carried out only in response to severe drought experience. Although most regions of Canada have experienced drought, the majority of studies have focused on the Prairies due to the greater frequency of droughts in this region. The variety in the forms of drought experienced in Canada needs to be taken into consideration when planning for possible health impacts. Given the complex interactions with water, a discussion of the impact of drought on soil through the health lens may add to the literature on water and water content alone.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent 2013 systematic review of the effectiveness of public health interventions to reduce the health impacts of climate change highlighted a gap in the literature around adaptation to drought [
    <a rid="B310-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B310-ijerph-12-08359">310</a>]. While there has been some effort to assess agricultural adaptation to drought [

Here, again, a lack of specificity around drought among other climate change-related extreme weather events limits the relevance of these discussions for public health planning.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potential adaptations to directly or indirectly reduce health risks from drought are plentiful, particularly those that address agricultural impacts of climate change and weather variability. Few adaptations are discussed specifically in the context of drought but are often put forward to address secondary concerns (e.g., vector-borne diseases). Factors influencing agriculture and agricultural practices are complex and sometimes contradictory, ranging from public level issues driven by policy, legislation and international agreements, to environmental and community issues relating to how land is used and the local impacts [
    <a rid="B287-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B287-ijerph-12-08359">287</a>]. To a large extent adaptations to drought are emerging from regional risk and adaptation case studies [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is an opportunity to address multiple climate change-related health impacts under broad public health adaptations. In addition, adaptation activities and programs in other sectors can contribute co-benefits to the agricultural sector. Programs that have been developed for other objectives, such as protecting wildlife or water, have been found to provide incidental benefits to the agricultural sector during drought periods. Such co-benefits are not well recognized, but constitute just short of two-thirds of activities captured in a national inventory of programs for managing drought and agricultural water in Canada [
