   <a rid="B62-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-12-08359">62</a>]. For example, in Ontario, de Loe and Berg [
   <a rid="B62-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-12-08359">62</a>] point to opportunities to “mainstream” climate change into source water protection planning within the Clean Water Act to help address anticipated changes to water supply and demand, including an increased frequency of drought [
   <a rid="B62-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-12-08359">62</a>]. Mainstreaming can be assisted by integrating learnings about effective risk management options and adaptations from experiences with current climate variability, particularly extreme weather events. However, mainstreaming also requires consideration and use of information about risks expected from future climate change in adaptation planning. A range of measures to adapt to changes in water quality and quantity in the context of climate change, such as leak detection, outreach, adjustments to the building code and management policies have been reported in the province of Quebec [

In Atlantic Canada, communities facing shortages or reduced water quality have made efforts to improve water treatment systems, conserve and protect surface water and develop new water sources through, for example, water capture [
   <a rid="B50-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-12-08359">50</a>]. Dams, desalination and water recycling are also being used to cope with the increased variability in water supply, although the cost and impacts of such actions are not well established [
   <a rid="B204-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B204-ijerph-12-08359">204</a>]. The health sector must actively be engaged in drought management at all levels of government.

   <a rid="B265-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B265-ijerph-12-08359">265</a>]. As this drought stretched on, impacts spread from dryland agricultural areas to impacts on state level electrical power supply. Lessons learned in a study of this drought identified inadequacies in water resource planning, the existence of responsible agencies along political rather than affected area boundaries and a lack of inter-jurisdictional communication as key factors. Water shortages continue to occur in California despite national freshwater draws (per capita) having dropped below levels seen in 1975 [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Canada, agricultural adaptation over the past century has included the development of new agricultural practices and infrastructure to conserve and enhance water supplies and distribution and targeted institutional activities to improve water management [

For example, less frequent tilling and reductions of other field management practices that lowered soil moisture and increased erosion aided in lowering the vulnerability of farmers to the 2001–2002 drought relative to the drought of the 1930s [

   <a rid="B287-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B287-ijerph-12-08359">287</a>]. A media analysis of adaptations undertaken in Canada during the 2001–2002 drought showed that the most frequently mentioned actions included measures related to irrigation, conservation and the management of water resources, insurance and other financial assistance programs (e.g., Canadian Farm Income Program, Net Income Stabilization Account), as well as government based low water responses [
   <a rid="B288-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B288-ijerph-12-08359">288</a>]. Irrigation in particular is one of the most broadly referenced agricultural adaptations to drought in the literature [
   <a rid="B289-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B289-ijerph-12-08359">289</a>]. The use of irrigation systems is increasing across Canada and irrigation is becoming more and more common in regions that had previously relied on rain and subsurface water (Saskatchewan has an Irrigation Strategy to grow and extend the use of irrigation across the province as part of their Water Security Plan

In Prince Edward Island the growing reliance on irrigation in potato farming and requests for new deep well licenses created serious concerns regarding the sustainability of groundwater supplies and whether or not a moratorium instituted over a decade earlier was still required [

   <a rid="B291-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B291-ijerph-12-08359">291</a>]. In November, 2014, a decision was made to uphold the moratorium. In more arid regions where water supplies are finite, like the Okanagan region of southern British Columbia, water demands are managed through a combination of monitoring and management among users (e.g., managing water catchments, use of high elevation dams, reservoirs and instituting seasonal use restrictions). In Alberta’s Oldman Dam water shortages have even been managed using a system of “sharing the shortage” in which users agree to share the reduced allocation of water due to drought [
   <a rid="B292-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B292-ijerph-12-08359">292</a>]. In 2001, partial allotments of 60% were successfully used to ensure the delivery of water supplies to all licensees.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water consumption can also be reduced by managing the timing of irrigation so that it targets the sensitive stages of crop development. In the case of corn, for example, yield losses may be reduced significantly by preventing water deficits at critical times in development; notably during the reproductive stages [
   <a rid="B293-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B293-ijerph-12-08359">293</a>,
   <a rid="B294-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B294-ijerph-12-08359">294</a>]. Even when plants are subjected to drought conditions, the timing and duration of the event must also be considered since plant processes can often recover following a period of drought if critical management actions are taken at the correct time (e.g., irrigation during flowering). Water conservation strategies and the timing and use of water (water management and irrigation timing) represent simple solutions that can be managed in response to need, when and where required (
   <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the farm scale). In contrast, technological and transgenic approaches will take time to develop [
   <a rid="B295-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B295-ijerph-12-08359">295</a>]. Moreover, since drought resistance is linked to overall plant performance, cultivars that are tolerant to extreme drought conditions may result in reduced production during less extreme or episodic drought conditions [

As such, farmers may need to balance trade-offs between production and the risk of drought in their choice of what to plant next season. Planting seeds representing a diversity of cultivar tolerance may prove beneficial in this case [
   <a rid="B299-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B299-ijerph-12-08359">299</a>]. The combined use of existing drought tolerant cultivars with physiologically sensitive timing of irrigation can serve to reduce water demands during key stages of development. Furthermore, since drought stressed plants and livestock are also more vulnerable to diseases, competition from invasive species and pests, strategies that increase genetic and crop diversity across fields and the landscape may represent adaptations that will provide overall benefits to both health and production [

Proximity to urban centers is thought to bring benefits related to off-farm incomes, access to technology (including computers/computing technologies), information networks (email, Internet) and access to agricultural institutions. Conversely, the lowest adaptive capacity was observed in areas more remote from urban centers, which were situated in more northern zones of this prairie belt. The importance of social networks and connectivity may be more obvious during periods of crisis, such as during the 2002 drought on the Prairies when farmers in eastern Canada who were less affected by drought shipped 64,000 bales of hay to western Canada through “Hay West” to support the worst struck areas [
