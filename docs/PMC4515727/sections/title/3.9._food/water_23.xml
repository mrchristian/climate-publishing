 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The IPCC recognizes a broad range of impacts due to climate change and the altered frequencies of associated extreme events, such as drought and floods that can have negative effects on crop production [

Food security can be affected through drought-related decreases in agricultural output, food shortages and higher food prices. Crop failures and reduced crop yields are of particular concern because they can have immediate and direct effects on both local and global food security [

  <a rid="B191-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B191-ijerph-12-08359">191</a>], Canada is unlikely to experience the types of food shortages that could occur in other countries. However, food insecurity may be reflected in food price volatility caused by international market shortages [
  <a rid="B192-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B192-ijerph-12-08359">192</a>], which could impact low income Canadians who find it difficult to pay higher prices for nutritious food. In addition, some individuals may be forced to use their resources to purchase water instead of food [
