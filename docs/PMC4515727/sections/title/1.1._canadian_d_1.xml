 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is currently no single, clear, consistent definition of drought. For the purposes of this discussion, drought will be considered a prolonged period of abnormally dry weather that depletes water resources for human and environmental needs [

  <a rid="B5-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-12-08359">5</a>]. Droughts stress water availability by lowering lake and reservoir levels, reducing stream flows, diminishing groundwater supplies and depleting soil moisture. Droughts can also create major environmental hazards such as reduced water quality, wetland loss, soil erosion and degradation, ecological habitat destruction and increased risk of wildfires. Prolonged, large-area droughts are one of Canada’s major natural disasters and can have large scale impacts on various sectors including human health and society, agriculture, forestry, industry, municipalities and recreation [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-08359">4</a>]. Droughts differ from other disasters (e.g., floods) since they have longer durations, lack easily identified onsets and terminations and their recurrence is practically certain in most environments including many regions of Canada [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-12-08359">6</a>]. Climate anomalies, lasting from a month to one or more years, are the root of most droughts, although human impacts on resources and climate and the changing demand for water are major contributing factors [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is no one “straightforward” manifestation of drought. Each drought manifests itself differently depending on factors, such as area affected, duration, intensity and society’s capability to adapt to water shortages. Thus, although the general features of drought tend to be similar, the actual features vary between droughts and evolve within a single drought. This complexity may lead to varying impacts [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-08359">8</a>,
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-08359">9</a>]. Some precipitation normally occurs even within a period of drought. It is not necessarily the case that the number of days with precipitation actually decreases during a drought; the relative lack of large precipitation events can for example be a contributor to drought formation. When it occurs during drought, precipitation tends to come in small amounts and to be highly scattered spatially due to convective processes, although more widespread rain can fall as well [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-08359">9</a>]. Sometimes, droughts can even be linked with heavy precipitation events. This can occur when the atmospheric forcing that is causing reduced precipitation in one region results in nearby areas receiving more rain than usual. The boundary between these regions can shift, thereby creating a situation in which conditions in some locations can alternate between both extremes. In some cases, the “end” or significant reduction of a drought can come in the form of a single heavy precipitation event. For example dry conditions in 2002 across the Prairies were alleviated by a torrential multi-day event [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surface air temperatures are often high/elevated during drought, although this is not always the case. For some long duration droughts, there are periods when temperatures are below normal [
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-12-08359">11</a>]. Droughts can also be windy or calm. Moderate to high winds can lead to erosion and transport of desiccated soil, although the number of these instances has generally declined, in part due to altered farming practices.
