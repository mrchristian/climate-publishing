  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-08359-f002" href="#ijerph-12-08359-f002">Figure 2</a>. For farm families, financial stress [
  <a rid="B51-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-12-08359">51</a>] and drought [
  <a rid="B219-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B219-ijerph-12-08359">219</a>] can amplify the other stressors they experience. For consumers with low socio-economic status, stress related to an increase in food costs or the decreased availability of food can also negatively impact mental health [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Australia has produced numerous studies regarding droughtâ€™s relationship to mental health. Negative drought-related impacts on mental health have been identified for older women and Aboriginal groups in Australia [

  <a rid="B221-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B221-ijerph-12-08359">221</a>], as well as for rural Australian youth [
  <a rid="B222-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B222-ijerph-12-08359">222</a>], with emotional stress increasing with the length of the drought [
  <a rid="B217-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B217-ijerph-12-08359">217</a>]. Dryland salinity, a phenomenon similar to drought, has also been associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for depression in Australia [
  <a rid="B223-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B223-ijerph-12-08359">223</a>]. Although Stehlik

  <a rid="B214-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B214-ijerph-12-08359">214</a>] found that drought-related stress negatively impacted relationships within farm families (Central Queensland, New South Wales, Australia), a later large-scale study across Australian agricultural communities did not find family relationships were negatively impacted by drought [
  <a rid="B224-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B224-ijerph-12-08359">224</a>]. For drought that was both constant and long (although not for either alone), there was a difference in the distress levels in rural and urban populations in Australia, with relatively higher levels among rural populations [
  <a rid="B225-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B225-ijerph-12-08359">225</a>]. The degradation of the physical environment associated with drying could also contribute to psychological distress for those who feel connected to the landscape (solastalgia) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research from New South Wales (Australia) found a statistically significant relationship between drought and suicide from 1964 to 2001 [
  <a rid="B227-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B227-ijerph-12-08359">227</a>]. Limited studies suggest that drought is a contributing factor to suicide among men in rural areas in Australia [

  <a rid="B230-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B230-ijerph-12-08359">230</a>] found a greater rate of suicide between 1988 and 1997 among male farm managers and agricultural labourers than among the male Australian population or the rural population overall, independent of drought.
