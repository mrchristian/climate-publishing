  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drought is often accompanied by dry, dusty conditions and dust storms, which can impact health [

   <a rid="B153-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B153-ijerph-12-08359">153</a>]. Climate change can lead to an increase in fine particulate matter, allergen and dust concentrations in the air in drought-prone areas [
   <a rid="B154-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B154-ijerph-12-08359">154</a>] which can have significant health impacts. A study of a lake desiccated through persistent drought in Saskatchewan found a greater prevalence of coughing, wheezing and eye and nasal irritation among residents living near the lake than among those in a control group [
   <a rid="B155-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B155-ijerph-12-08359">155</a>]. PM

   <a rid="B156-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B156-ijerph-12-08359">156</a>] although dust storms were not associated with an increased risk of mortality [
   <a rid="B157-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B157-ijerph-12-08359">157</a>]. Air-borne toxins from algal blooms, which can be increased due to drought conditions, can also irritate the respiratory system, nose and eyes [

   <a rid="B152-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B152-ijerph-12-08359">152</a>]. In Ontario, Charron

   <a rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-12-08359">52</a>] noted the possibility that drought with strong winds could lead to the transmission of Rickettsial diseases to humans from infected livestock.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dry conditions can increase nitrate levels in corn plants and encourage the accumulation of nitrogen dioxide (NO

   <a rid="B167-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B167-ijerph-12-08359">167</a>]. Record warm and dry conditions in British Columbia over the same summer and preceding winter also set the stage for a wildfire season that saw more than seven and a half times the 20 year average in land area burned in 2014 [
   <a rid="B167-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B167-ijerph-12-08359">167</a>]. Wildfires are expected to become more frequent and severe in many parts of Canada with climate change [

Further, drought has been associated with periods of extreme heat which can present a range of health impacts that need to be addressed. In addition to its direct impact on human health, extreme heat can add to drought-related stress on agriculture with knock-on effects discussed below. For example, an extreme heat event that took place in Russia over July and August, 2010 reduced the country’s grain yield by 25%, resulting in increases in food prices and losses estimated at $15 billion [
