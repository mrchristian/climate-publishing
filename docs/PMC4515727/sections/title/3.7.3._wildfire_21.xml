 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drought has been associated with wildfires in both Canada and the U.S. and is expected to increase the number of wildfires in the Prairies specifically [

  <a rid="B162-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B162-ijerph-12-08359">162</a>]. During a prolonged forest fire in British Columbia, Canada in 2003 one community experienced a 46%–78% increase in physician visits for respiratory diseases [

  <a rid="B51-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-12-08359">51</a>] and may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder [

  <a rid="B166-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B166-ijerph-12-08359">166</a>].In the Northwest Territories, a dry winter combined with only half the typical amount of rainfall over the summer of 2014 and above average temperatures, was accompanied by the worst fire season in 30 years [
  <a rid="B167-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B167-ijerph-12-08359">167</a>]. Record warm and dry conditions in British Columbia over the same summer and preceding winter also set the stage for a wildfire season that saw more than seven and a half times the 20 year average in land area burned in 2014 [
  <a rid="B167-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B167-ijerph-12-08359">167</a>]. Wildfires are expected to become more frequent and severe in many parts of Canada with climate change [

Further, drought has been associated with periods of extreme heat which can present a range of health impacts that need to be addressed. In addition to its direct impact on human health, extreme heat can add to drought-related stress on agriculture with knock-on effects discussed below. For example, an extreme heat event that took place in Russia over July and August, 2010 reduced the country’s grain yield by 25%, resulting in increases in food prices and losses estimated at $15 billion [
