 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During drought, there can be a drop in pressure at water treatment plants [
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-12-08359">52</a>], which can increase turbidity leading to a greater potential risk of water contamination and consequently a greater need for water treatment [

  <a rid="B85-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijerph-12-08359">85</a>]. The impact of drought on contaminant levels in source water has been discussed above. In the event that well water becomes unavailable during drought, turning to alternative water sources can also increase risks to health if appropriate safeguards for those treatment measures are not in place [
  <a rid="B86-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86-ijerph-12-08359">86</a>]. Inadequate water treatment is important as pathogens, including bacteria and viruses, are known to be taken up by particles in water [
  <a rid="B87-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87-ijerph-12-08359">87</a>]. Costs also increase with the additional treatment required to address higher levels of turbidity [

  <a rid="B89-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89-ijerph-12-08359">89</a>]. Changes to water flow and levels associated with climate change could further contribute to stress on water treatment systems and increase the cost of treatment [
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-12-08359">50</a>]. In northern Ontario, some First Nations communities may already be near the limit of their capacity in this regard [
