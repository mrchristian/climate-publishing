  <a rid="B103-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B103-ijerph-12-08359">103</a>] based on recent historical data suggested that health damage from infectious diseases resulting from domestic water scarcity would be relatively low in the U.S. compared with other regions, although the health damage could not be modeled for Canada. However, in England and Wales, both low and excessive rainfall over the short-term was linked to a rise in the incidence of diarrhoea related to

  <a rid="B74-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74-ijerph-12-08359">74</a>]. As described above, 
  <span class="italic">Giardia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Cryptosporidium</span>, 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> cause a considerable number of disease cases in Canada each year. Alteration of the rates of such diseases by drought could have implications for public health.
