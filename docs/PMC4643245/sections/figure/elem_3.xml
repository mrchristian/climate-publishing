  <p>Hazard rate in relation to minimum temperature and diurnal temperature range (DTR) in easy (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) and semi-natural (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) foraging environment for the best fitting model of 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>. Fitted lines represent hazard rates for different weighted minimum temperatures (temperatures plotted at line ends) calculated for individuals with a study age at start of 1 year old (population mean) and 0.36 years in study (at which 90% of the population is alive). Lines cover 95% of the data range. See 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</a> for a contour plot with data distribution and hazard rates.
