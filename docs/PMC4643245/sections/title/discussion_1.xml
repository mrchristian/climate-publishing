 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A large DTR substantially increased mortality rate and this effect was modulated by minimum temperature, age and environment, but not by developmental conditions. That DTR affects mortality is relevant because climate change is associated with changes in temperature variability on short time scales, i.e. days
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">13</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">14</a>. Yet, to our knowledge this is the first study on the mortality consequences of changes in DTR in a non-human endotherm. Our study shows that changes in DTR can potentially pose a threat to the population viability of endotherms and that this threat is most apparent in semi-natural environments. Note however that our study exploited natural variation in DTR and hence we cannot exclude the possibility that other climatic variables contributed to the observed patterns.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results indicate that responses to changes in climate variability differ considerably between laboratory and semi-natural environments, in that foraging costs determined the temperature range at which birds are most susceptible to large DTR. DTR increased mortality more on days with 
  <span class="italic">low</span> minimum temperature in an easy foraging environment, but more on days with 
  <span class="italic">high</span> minimum temperature in a semi-natural foraging environment. A possible reason for such environment dependent effects is heat stress, which in this experiment can arise in the semi-natural foraging environment because of the combination of high temperatures with unavoidable heat production through increased foraging effort, which can have major effects on bird behaviour and physiology
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">44</a>. Muscular exercise decreases heat tolerance because it generates heat which needs to be dissipated to avoid for example mitochondrial and immune dysfunction, DNA damage, organ failure and even death

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">50</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">51</a>. Such interaction effects are important when estimating the biological consequences of climate change
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">52</a>. Our results indicate that climate change experiments in laboratory conditions may not simply underestimate impacts of climate change, but may provide completely contradictory results to natural conditions. Since climate change is associated with increases in minimum temperatures
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">13</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">14</a>, our result also suggests that the DTR effect in natural populations may become more important in a warming world.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Associations between DTR and survival changed with age (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Fig. S3</a>). The dependence of the DTR effect on age may be due to individual heterogeneity in combination with selective disappearance: individuals that are sensitive to large DTR die and thus only birds that are relatively DTR insensitive remain at old age. It is worth noting that in natural populations the majority of individuals are young
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">53</a> and hence natural populations are likely to be more susceptible to DTR effects than our relatively protected study population.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the time window over which climate variables affected mortality, and found this to differ considerably between climatic variables, with MinT having a more immediate effect than DTR. The contrast between these time windows indicates that these climatic variables affect mortality through mechanisms that operate on different time scales. That MinT affected mortality on a short time scale is likely to reflect limits on the instantenous capacity to generate heat. We are less certain regarding the mechanism through which DTR affects mortality. However, birds adjust physiologically their energy allocation to ambient temperatures within days
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">54</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">55</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">56</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">57</a> and short term temperature variation increases daily energy expenditure
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">58</a>. The delayed DTR effect may thus reflect increased vulnerability due to the cumulative physiological acclimatization costs when DTR is high for a prolonged period.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, our results show that DTR strongly affects avian mortality. DTR effects on mortality have previously been demonstrated in one other endotherm, humans, but our finding of an almost two-fold increase in mortality per °C DTR substantially exceeds the 1–3% increase in hospital admissions and 1% increase in mortality found in humans

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>. We note however that time windows over which DTR affects human mortality have to our knowledge not been quantified, and by definition such an analysis would yield stronger DTR effects than hitherto reported. In humans, large DTR is associated with cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunctions, causing increased hospital admissions and mortality
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a> but whether the same mechanisms causes the DTR effects in birds remains to be established. Understanding the physiological mechanisms involved in the DTR effect is of interest in its own right, and may help predict which and when populations are most at risk. However, regardless of the underlying physiological mechanisms, our results, together with those found in humans, show that DTR effects are important for survival and hence for understanding and predicting population responses to climate change
