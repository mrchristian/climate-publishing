 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As deterministic models like the ET algorithm used in this study don’t have stochastic element and relevant replications, a common method to assess the average contribution of each input factor (main effect) to the response variable is to compare the difference of response variable between the simulation with only one varied factor and the control simulation

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">46</a>. The control simulation (CONTROL) in this study is the simulation driven by the mean (i.e. the multi-year mean for individual day of the Julian days) environmental and vegetation conditions of the 1980’s (1982–1989). The ET result from the control simulation represents the expected value given the normal 1980’s environmental and vegetation conditions. For example, the main effects of

  <sub>T</sub>) are:

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The other two-way interactive effects are calculated using the same methods. To derive the main and two-way interactive effects of all six factors, we conducted 23 sets of factorial simulations (summarized in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>): one control simulation driven by mean environmental and vegetation conditions of the 1980’s (1982–1989); six simulations where only one of the six factors is varied each time; and fifteen simulations where two of six factors were varied for each model run. The sum of all higher-order interactive effects is the difference between (

  <span class="italic">f</span>(

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All temporal trends in this study were estimated using the Kendall-Theil robust line and tested by the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test. Temporal anomalies were computed on a grid cell-by-cell basis and over the entire global domain relative to average conditions defined by the 32-year record. The null hypothesis of the trend testing is: there is no trend. The null hypothesis of the linear correlation testing is: there is no linear correlation between two variables. Statistical significance of the resulting trends was classified at α values of 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01. If a 
  <span class="italic">P</span>-value is smaller than a given α, the null hypothesis is rejected at a significance level of α.
