 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The remote-sensing-driven ET algorithm used in this study is called Process-based Land Surface Evapotranspiration/Heat Fluxes algorithm (P-LSH). P-LSH quantifies canopy transpiration using the Penman-Monteith (PM) approach coupled with biome-specific canopy conductance determined from NDVI, soil evaporation through a modified PM approach, and open water evaporation using the Penman equation. The core components of this algorithm (i.e., the baseline algorithm) are described in Zhang

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>. In this study, we made the following improvements to the baseline algorithm to account for the influence of variable wind speed and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations on respective model aerodynamic conductance and canopy stomatal conductance terms, and resulting ET calculations: (1) quantify the impacts of increasing atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations on canopy stomatal conductance through a CO
  <sub>2</sub> constraint function used in the MOSES land surface scheme
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>, (2) use surface wind speed to calculate aerodynamic conductance following Monteith and Unsworth
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>, and (3) replace the Priestley-Taylor method

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a> to estimate open water evaporation and potential evaporation (PET) for considering the impacts of changes in surface wind speed on open water evaporation. More details on the improvements of this P-LSH algorithm are described in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Section 1</a>. Although the P-LSH algorithm do not explicitly account for the effects of local perturbations, such as land use and irrigation, on ET, which may influence local ET estimates, it at least takes these effects into account to some extent from the satellite-observed NDVI data. Besides the vegetation dynamics (V) quantified by the NDVI data, the other forcing data of this algorithm include air temperature (T) and vapor pressure (H), wind speed (W), surface radiation fluxes (R), and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration (C).
