The most commonly used of such metrics is the velocity of climate change, which estimates the speed at which species must migrate over the earth&#x02019;s surface to maintain constant climatic conditions. However, &#x0201c;analog-based&#x0201d; velocities, which represent the actual distance to where analogous climates will be found in the future, may provide contrasting results to the more common form of velocity based on local climate gradients. Additionally, whereas climatic velocity reflects the exposure of organisms to climate change, resultant biotic effects are dependent on the sensitivity of individual species as reflected in part by their climatic niche width. This has motivated development of biotic velocity, a metric which uses data on projected species range shifts to estimate the velocity at which species must move to track their climatic niche. We calculated climatic and biotic velocity for the Western Hemisphere for 1961&#x02013;2100, and applied the results to example ecological and conservation planning questions, to demonstrate the potential of such analog-based metrics to provide information on broad-scale patterns of exposure and sensitivity. Geographic patterns of biotic velocity for 2954 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians differed from climatic velocity in north temperate and boreal regions. However, both biotic and climatic velocities were greatest at low latitudes, implying that threats to equatorial species arise from both the future magnitude of climatic velocities and the narrow climatic tolerances of species in these regions, which currently experience low seasonal and interannual climatic variability. Biotic and climatic velocity, by approximating lower and upper bounds on migration rates, can inform conservation of species and locally-adapted populations, respectively, and in combination with backward velocity, a function of distance to a source of colonizers adapted to a site&#x02019;s future climate, can facilitate conservation of diversity at multiple scales in the face of climate change.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by a grant from the Wilburforce Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wilburforce.org">www.wilburforce.org</ext-link>) to CC, JJL, and DRR.

As climate shifts over the coming decades, such metrics can help us predict which species are likely to adapt in place to new climatic conditions, disperse and establish in areas with newly suitable climate, or face the prospect of extirpation [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Such information also allows us to evaluate whether specific sites, such as existing protected areas, will serve as refugia or face loss of species and consequent changes in ecosystem processes [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The most commonly used of such metrics is the velocity of climate change, which estimates the speed at which species must migrate over the earth&#x02019;s surface to maintain constant climatic conditions. As originally proposed, climatic velocity is derived by dividing the temporal rate of projected climate change by the current gradient of climate variability across a spatial neighborhood [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This method, which has been termed &#x0201c;local&#x0201d; velocity [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), only considers spatial variability within the immediate neighborhood of a location. Consequently, the rate of migration necessary to maintain constant climate conditions may be underestimated in alpine and arctic regions if velocity vectors point toward climatic cul-de-sacs, i.e. by pointing beyond mountain tops or polar edges of continents [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Secondly, velocity may approach infinity in flat areas, even if similar future climates are found just beyond the focal neighborhood.</p><fig id="pone.0140486.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0140486.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Conceptual diagram contrasting four types of velocity metric used in climate adaptation planning, categorized in terms of the method and type of data used.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0140486.g001"/></fig><p>Because of these factors, a metric based on the actual distance between a location and the location where a similar (analogous) climate will be found in the future forms a valuable complement to local velocity [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Deriving such &#x0201c;analog-based&#x0201d; velocity (<xref rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) can be computationally challenging, because it requires a search over the entire extent of the data to identify the most spatially-proximate cell which is an analog of the focal cell based on the environmental attribute(s) of interest. However, recent advances in efficient nearest-neighbor search algorithms have made such global searches computationally feasible for high-resolution raster datasets [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The shift of the search radius from a neighborhood to the entire extent of the data enhances the relevance of the velocity metric, especially for mobile species that may disperse over larger distances than can be evaluated in a neighborhood-based search.</p><p>Additionally, nearest-neighbor search allows calculation of both forward velocities (the distance from current climate locations to the nearest site with an analogous future climate; <xref rid="pone.0140486.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and backward velocities (the distance from projected future climate cells back to analogous current climate locations; <xref rid="pone.0140486.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). At first glance, these two forms of velocity based on the same inputs appear to differ only in their opposing time directions. However, the two calculations can yield profoundly different results which provide contrasting but complementary information to support conservation of species and their populations. Forward velocity reflects the minimum distance an organism in the current landscape must migrate to maintain constant climate condition. Because forward velocity reflects the exposure of organisms to climate change, the metric is particularly relevant in assessing the conservation status of species and their populations under climate change. Forward velocity will often be high in alpine areas because reaching the nearest analogous future climate may require dispersal to distant higher elevation mountaintops (<xref rid="pone.0140486.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, lower panel).</p><fig id="pone.0140486.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0140486.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Conceptual diagram contrasting a) forward and b) backward velocity.</title><p>Upper panels illustrate contrasts between how the two metrics are derived. Lower panels show a high resolution map of the contrast between forward and backward velocity in mountainous terrain, as well as a diagram illustrating the source of these contrasts. The colors of trees in the diagram correspond to the velocity expected in that topographic position, with the corresponding arrows of the same color either originating from (forward velocity) or terminating at that topographic position.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0140486.g002"/></fig><p>Backward velocity reflects the minimum distance, given the projected future conditions at a site, that a climatically-adapted organism would have to migrate to colonize the site. Backward velocity reflects the relative difficulty of species faces in colonizing newly suitable habitat via dispersal or gene flow (e.g., via pollen) [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Backward velocity, unlike forward velocity, is generally low in alpine areas, because adapted organisms can reach the site from nearby downslope locations. Conversely, valley bottom habitat may lack nearby climate analogs, and organisms would have to travel longer distances to colonize these locally new habitat conditions (<xref rid="pone.0140486.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, lower panel).</p><p>Forward velocity measures the distance from a single source to multiple future destinations (<xref rid="pone.0140486.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, top panel). Conversely, backward velocity considers the distance between disparate source locations and a single future destination (<xref rid="pone.0140486.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, top panel). Therefore, the use of these two metrics in planning will typically imply a contrasting focus on species/populations (forward velocity) or sites (backward velocity). While species inhabiting a site with high forward velocity are potentially threatened with extinction, a site with high backward velocity is threatened with holding a depauperate complement of species adapted to its future climate, with consequent effects on ecosystem function and services.</p><p>The distinction between local and analog-based velocity is also relevant for velocities based on projections from climatic niche models (a type of model based on correlations between species distributions and current climatic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). A local metric, termed &#x0201c;bioclimatic&#x0201d; velocity [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], can be calculated based on the modeled probability of species occurrence (inferring habitat suitability). This habitat suitability metric is treated as equivalent to a climate variable in local climatic velocity, in that velocity is derived by dividing the rate of change over time in a continuous habitat suitability metric by the rate of change in that metric within the local neighborhood (<xref rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). In contrast, an analog-based metric, termed &#x0201c;biotic velocity&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], represents the distance between a site and the nearest site projected to be climatically suitable for the species under future projected climates (<xref rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). The metric can be reported on a per-species basis or averaged across a taxa group. Because it is based on a binary classification of the landscape into suitable and unsuitable areas, biotic velocity sacrifices information on local habitat gradients in order to incorporate information on broad-scale patterns in range shifts.</p><p>Several studies have determined that historical climatic velocity is correlated with past species range shifts [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast to historical studies, forward-looking comparisons rely on projected range shifts as a response variable, which imperfectly represents the actual pattern of future species movements. However, comparison of biotic and climatic velocity based on future climate projections is critical in informing planners as to whether the higher level of model complexity represented by climatic niche models results in qualitatively different threat patterns and conservation priorities. For example, a strategy for identification and conservation of refugia [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] would be more complex if areas of low biotic velocity did not overlap with areas of low climatic velocity. In general, consideration of a suite of climate-related metrics results in more robust threat assessments than could a focus on any one measure in isolation [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Climate displacements derived from multiple bioclimatic variables show more complex and informative patterns than those shown by the magnitude of temperature change alone [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We developed multivariate climatic velocity for North and South America based on a principal components analysis of 37 bioclimatic variables, using data derived from ten GCMs for the SRES A2 emissions scenario [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0140486.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). We developed biotic velocity from multivariate climatic niche models for 2954 terrestrial species (1818 birds, 723 mammals and 413 amphibians) based on a previously-published analysis that projected shifts in the geographic distribution of climatic suitability from a current historical (1961&#x02013;1990) to a future (2071&#x02013;2100) habitat time period, based on the ten GCM projections [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The hemispheric extent allowed us to compare the two metrics across a diverse set of biomes that vary widely in their climatic and biogeographic attributes. We also compared the distribution of disappearing climates and species.</p><p>Previous studies have mapped local or neighborhood-based climatic velocity [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and disappearing climates [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] at a global scale, as well as distance to future analogous climates in Europe [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Analog-based biotic velocity has been assessed between current and paleoclimates for North American trees [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and between current and future projected climates for Western Hemisphere mammals [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Local bioclimatic velocity has been analyzed for California tree species [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this study, we provide the first comparison of analog-based climatic and biotic velocity between current and projected future climate over a broad taxonomic and geographic scope.</p><p>Because analog-based velocity searches beyond a local neighborhood (<xref rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), the metric effectively integrates factors that influence climate at a range of spatial scales, including local topographic gradients, regional topographic position, and location in relationship to continental margins and synoptic weather systems. In this study, we use two examples to demonstrate how such information on broad-scale patterns of exposure and sensitivity enhances the relevance of the velocity metric to conservation planning. Firstly, we use analog-based velocity to evaluate how climatic vulnerability varies with latitude. We ask whether potential threats are greater in equatorial, temperate, or boreal regions, and whether these threats derive primarily from the magnitude of climate change or the differential sensitivity of taxa in different regions. Secondly, we demonstrate how to integrate results from a suite of complementary velocity metrics, using an example focusing on climate-related threats to protected areas of the Western Hemisphere. By placing the sometimes confusing variety of previously-proposed velocity metrics in a coherent framework, and demonstrating how they can be integrated to inform a multi-faceted threat assessment, we hope to stimulate their more widespread use in the increasing number of planning efforts focused on conserving landscape-scale climate resilience and adaptation potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Climatic velocity</title><p>Climate data were downscaled to a 50km by 50km grid using locally weighted, lapse-rate-adjusted interpolation. Monthly climate data from 1961 to 1990 were then averaged to produce a base-line time period. Future climate projections were taken from ten general circulation model (GCM) simulations archived by the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3)(<xref rid="pone.0140486.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Climate projections were averaged over a 30-year period from 2071 to 2100 and represent climates simulated for a mid-to-high (SRES A2) greenhouse-gas emissions scenario [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thirty-seven bioclimatic variables were developed from the primary climate data [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0140486.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p><p>A mid-to-high emissions scenario (SRES A2) was selected because the recent global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions trajectory has fallen at the high end of the range of projections used in IPCC scenarios [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Use of previously-published niche models limited the analysis to CMIP3 data rather than the recently-released CMIP5 projections. However, because CMIP5 projections are an incremental advance over CMIP3 data [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], this decision does not substantially limit the relevance of our results as a tool for threat assessment. Temperature projections from the SRES A2 scenario are intermediate to those of CMIP5 representative concentration pathways (RCP) 6.0 and 8.5 [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>We used a direct estimate of climatic velocity, or the distance between a location and the nearest location with analogous climate in the future [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Climate analogs were identified using multivariate Euclidean climate distance estimated from the first 5 axes of a principal components analysis of the 37 bioclimatic variables. Use of multivariate Euclidean distance based on PCA scores reduced the effect of collinearity between bioclimatic variables and approximated a Mahalanobis distance based on the original set of variables.</p><p>Principal components analysis of the 37 bioclimatic variables resulted in first and second PCA component dominated by temperature and precipitation, respectively. These two components captured 57.2% and 20.6% of total variance, respectively. The five components capturing greater than 2% of variance each, which cumulatively captured 91.4% of total variance, were used in the subsequent velocity calculations. We used equally spaced intervals to divide current and future climate space into multivariate bins. Because the width of each bin was maintained across all 5 PCA axes, the number of bins on each axis, and its importance in determining a climate analog, is approximately proportional to the variance explained by that axis.</p><p>The degree of similarity which constitutes an analogous climate type (i.e., the width of a climate bin) is a key parameter in derivation of analog-based velocity. In a two-dimensional plot of the first two PCA components, these bins can be visualized as rectangular areas with similar climate values in multivariate space. Given enough precision in measurements, no two grid cells will have the same climate value. As bin width widens and precision decreases, velocity values decrease to the point where information is lost because many areas show zero velocity (<xref rid="pone.0140486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>)[<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Conversely, as bin width narrows past a certain threshold, the proportion of no-analog climates, which also hold limited information value, sharply increases (<xref rid="pone.0140486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We found that a bin width of 2 PCA units optimized the information value of the resulting velocity maps by balancing loss of information due to excessively broad bins versus domination of the results by disappearing or no-analog climates due to excessively narrow bins (<xref rid="pone.0140486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>For each unique climate type (bin), we identified cells (sites or pixels) within that type under both current and projected climates. Then, we used fast approximate-nearest-neighbor algorithms (using the R package yaImpute [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; see <xref rid="pone.0140486.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://adaptwest.databasin.org/">http://adaptwest.databasin.org</ext-link> for code) to identify, for each current cell, the nearest cell of the same type under future climates. This distance provided the basis for deriving forward climatic velocity. Additionally, for each future cell, we identified the nearest neighboring cell of the same type under current climate. This distance provided the basis for deriving backward climatic velocity [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Cells for which no match can be found in the other time period represent cells which have velocities that extend beyond the analysis region. Although these areas could be assigned an arbitrarily high velocity value, this would obscure patterns in the velocity results. Therefore, the probability of disappearance of climate types (as well as of species; see below) was tabulated separately from calculations of climatic velocity. Disappearing or no-analog climates can also arise as an artifact of the arbitrary boundaries between climate bins. We incrementally offset bin boundaries over 100 replicated velocity calculations and averaged the results to eliminate this effect. We then averaged velocities from the ten GCMs to derive a mean velocity value.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Biotic velocity</title><p>Climatic niche models for the North and South American continents, at 50 km resolution, were drawn from a previously-published study [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which assessed the potential effects of climate change on distribution of 2954 vertebrate species (1818 birds, 723 mammals, and 413 amphibians) in the Western Hemisphere.

However, they are useful in taxonomically comprehensive assessments where point locations of species&#x02019; occurrences are unavailable for a subset of the species considered [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The 50 km resolution was chosen to strike a balance between inaccuracies due to applying a fine-resolution grid to relatively coarse resolution digital-range maps and inaccuracies due to mapping climate at too coarse a resolution. Niche models were developed using the same 37 bioclimatic variables used in deriving climatic velocity (<xref rid="pone.0140486.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p><p>Niche models were built using random forest predictors, an ensemble-based machine-learning approach based on combining predictions from multiple classification or regression trees built using random subsets of the data and predictor variables [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For each model, a threshold for predicting presence was determined using the receiver-operating characteristic curve with the assumption that correctly predicting a presence was as important as predicting an absence [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Models for 2954 species were able to correctly predict at least 90% of the absences and 80% of the presences in the reserved test data sets. These models were then used to project areas that will likely be climatically suitable under the ten GCM projections of future climates.</p><p>We calculated biotic velocity based on climatic niche model projections from each of the ten GCMs. To calculate forward velocity, we assigned each cell within the current range of the species a velocity based on the distance to the nearest cell of future climatically suitable habitat (see <xref rid="pone.0140486.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://adaptwest.databasin.org/">http://adaptwest.databasin.org</ext-link> for code). To calculate backward velocity, we assigned each cell within the future projected range of a species a velocity based on the distance to the nearest cell of current climatically suitable habitat. We averaged resultant velocities to derive a mean value for each of the three taxa groups (birds, mammals, and amphibians). For each cell, we also calculated the probability of a species disappearing at that site. We used probability rather than number of species disappearing at each site to reduce correlation of the metric with gradients in current species diversity.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Comparison of climatic and biotic velocity</title><p>We compared climatic and biotic velocity metrics using four methods. Firstly, we calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the metrics. Secondly, we used generalized-additive models [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] to assess latitudinal gradients in climatic and biotic velocity. We assessed whether the relative intensity of climatic velocity was greatest in equatorial, temperate, or boreal regions, and whether biotic velocity mirrored or contrasted the latitudinal patterns shown by climatic velocity. If climatic and biotic velocity values peak in different latitudinal regions, this would imply that relative importance of exposure vs. sensitivity in producing climate-related vulnerability differs with latitude. Specifically, we hypothesized that climatic velocity would peak in boreal regions, which have experienced the greatest magnitude of anthropogenic climate change to date [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but that the generally narrower ranges of tropical species would cause the peak values of biotic velocity to occur outside the polar regions.</p><p>Thirdly, we compared the distribution of velocity values between latitudinal zones and between major climatic zones (defined in terms of the Koppen-Gieger system [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) using plots based on kernel density estimators and beanplots [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We evaluated three distinct types of variation in the results. On a per-cell basis, we calculated variation (standard deviation) in velocity values between GCMs and between species within a taxa group. Taking the mean biotic velocities for each cell, we evaluated their variation across space to illustrate the degree of contrast between refugia and high velocity areas within a climate zone or latitudinal band. Taking the mean velocities for each species within a climatic zone, we evaluated variation between species within a taxa group to illustrate whether geographic patterns were general to most species or driven by a subset of highly vulnerable species.</p><p>Lastly, we analyzed the vulnerability of major protected areas (i.e., those of area &#x0003e;200 km<sup>2</sup>; data available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/">www.protectedplanet.net/</ext-link>) of the Americas based on the various velocity metrics, by calculating the mean of velocity values within the extent of the protected area.

The simplest metrics for assessing vulnerability to climate change consider only variation across space (e.g., diversity of elevation, aspect, or current climate)[<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Climatic velocity additionally considers variation along a temporal axis. Biotic velocity adds consideration of a third ecological axis by incorporating information on the climatic niche breadth of individual species.</p><p>When seen in this framework, the velocity metrics considered here provide complementary sources of information for threat assessment and conservation planning under climate change. To provide informative results, the analog-based climatic velocity method must use a relatively narrow range of climatic conditions to define what constitutes a &#x0201c;match&#x0201d; between current and projected future climates. Climatic velocities therefore represent an upper bound of migration requirements because they effectively assume negligible climatic tolerances or adaptive capacities of populations inhabiting a site.</p><p>In contrast, biotic velocity is derived from climatic niche models which assume climatic tolerances based on a species&#x02019; realized niche. Biotic velocities provide a lower estimate of migration requirements which assumes local populations can adapt to any climatic conditions encountered within the full range of the species distribution. If a species&#x02019; fundamental niche is broader than the realized niche evident from current distribution data, or if adaptation allows a species to broaden its climatic niche over time, biotic velocity estimates will still be greater than the actual movement rate required for species persistence.</p><p>The large contrast between our mean estimates of climatic and biotic velocity demonstrates the contrast in magnitude that might be expected between estimates of the climatic tolerances of a species as a whole and estimates that assume a population is narrowly adapted to local climatic conditions. The magnitude of analog-based climatic velocity does depend in part on the parameter that defines how similar two climates must be to be considered as analogous (<xref rid="pone.0140486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). In principle, use of a climate bin width as broad as the climatic niche width of the average species could reduce climatic velocity values to a level similar to biotic velocity. In practice, results from such an analysis would be uninformative due to the presence of large regions with zero velocity (<xref rid="pone.0140486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Climatic velocity is often seen as a useful surrogate metric for assessment of climate exposure when species-specific information is lacking [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For example, climatic velocity may be used to assess vulnerability of localized endemic species which have too few observations with which to successfully construct niche models. However, our results suggest that biotic and climatic velocity can serve complementary roles within a conservation planning process even when species-specific information is available. Consideration of climatic velocity can help address conservation of locally-adapted populations, a facet of the extinction crisis that is often ignored in conservation planning [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Comparison of the geographic patterns of biotic and climatic velocity also helps planners distinguish regions where climatic velocity may be an adequate surrogate for climatic threats to biodiversity from regions where biogeographic factors play a greater role in influencing species vulnerability.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Strengths and limitations of analog-based velocity vs. local velocity</title><p>Previous reviews have emphasized the importance of considering fine-scale topography that may create microrefugia that allow species to persist in place, as well as the large-scale climate patterns that can push species off mountaintops or the poleward edges of continents [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Because our method for calculating analog-based velocity is computationally efficient for even high-resolution climate surfaces, it can capture both fine and broad-scale factors within a single metric. However, analog-based velocity does carry some limitations compared to local velocity (<xref rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), and thus is best viewed as a complement to the latter metric, especially for vagile species which can disperse beyond the extent of a local neighborhood.</p><p>Recent studies have used local climatic velocity to estimate the movement vectors or paths that would allow organisms to track climatic conditions over broader continental scales [<xref rid="pone.0140486.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].
