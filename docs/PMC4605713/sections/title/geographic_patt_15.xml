 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our hypothesis that future projected climatic velocity would peak in boreal regions was not supported. Our results instead suggest that areas of high future climatic velocity will not be confined to areas such as the boreal region which have experienced high climatic velocity in the past, but will extend into equatorial regions which have previously experienced low climatic velocity [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref014">14</a>]. Previous studies have proposed that the narrower thermal tolerances of tropical organisms make them most vulnerable to climate change despite a lower absolute magnitude of climate change in tropical regions [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref049">49</a>]. In our results, however, threats to equatorial species arise from both the future magnitude of exposure to climatic change (climatic velocity) and the narrow climatic tolerances of species in these equatorial regions, which currently experience low seasonal and interannual climatic variability [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref050">50</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref052">52</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This result agrees with previous studies which found that tropical regions, and the Amazon basin in particular, were highly threatened by future climate change. Projected future change in monthly temperature, when expressed in standard deviations from historical values rather than as absolute temperature change, projects greatest change to occur in tropical regions [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref053">53</a>]. The Amazon basin has been ranked among the global regions with the highest distances to areas with projected future temperatures similar or cooler than current temperatures [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref054">54</a>], and also among the regions most dominated by future novel climates [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref023">23</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref055">55</a>]. Although the equatorial zone generally showed higher exposure than other latitudes, a wide range of velocities was also evident at finer scales within latitudinal zones (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g003">Fig 3</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s004">S4 Fig</a>), illustrating the importance of identifying and protecting refugia within otherwise vulnerable areas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plotting the hemisphere’s protected areas in terms of the four velocity metrics (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g006" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g006">Fig 6</a>) reveals that most equatorial protected areas are highly vulnerable from the perspective of both forward and backward biotic velocities as well as forward climatic velocity. In contrast, polar protected areas showed a wide range of vulnerability to both climatic velocity and forward biotic velocity, and thus appropriate adaptation strategies will differ more widely in this region. Similar quadrant plots of forward and backward biotic and climatic velocity can be applied at a finer scale to inform regional or local planning efforts.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The species distributions used to develop biotic velocity estimates may be limited by historical biogeographic factors and limited dispersal ability, and thus underrepresent species’ potential climatic tolerances [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref056">56</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref057">57</a>]. However, this potential resilience is counterbalanced by the smaller population sizes and lower dispersal ability typical of narrow range species, which may place them at “double jeopardy” from climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref056">56</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previously, areas in Europe holding many restricted-range plant and butterfly species were found to hold climates that were more likely to be lost in the future [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref058">58</a>]. However, our results suggest a low correlation between areas of disappearing climates and species in the Americas. This contrast may be due to the contrasting historical biogeography of Europe and the Americas, or the contrasting taxonomic focus of the two studies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biotic velocity is similar to climatic velocity in that it synthesizes a large volume of data into a single metric that facilitates comprehension of common patterns across a range of variables. The contrasts in vulnerability between climate zones we observed appear robust in that they are not driven by a few highly vulnerable species (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s006">S6 Fig</a>). Nonetheless, there is substantial variation in the velocities experienced by different species within the large taxonomic groups we considered (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s006">S6 Fig</a>). Although aggregate metrics are a useful tool for discerning broad-scale threat patterns, conservation strategies will ultimately require consideration of individualistic species responses.
