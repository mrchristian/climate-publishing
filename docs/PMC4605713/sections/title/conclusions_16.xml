 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conservation planners have long realized that any one metric or set of targets can serve as only an imperfect surrogate for the larger goal of biodiversity conservation [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref059">59</a>]. Our results suggest that geographic patterns of vulnerability to climate change differ depending on whether conservation of locally-adapted populations, species, or sites is of primary interest. This contrast should be considered when identifying areas which may function as refugia or conversely are likely to be at high risk of biodiversity loss under climate change.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent reviews have advocated consideration of multiple metrics of exposure to climate change [

  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref060">60</a>]. Consideration of both climatic and biotic velocity allows such a coarse-filter/fine-filter approach to be extended to address the novel context of conservation under climate change [
