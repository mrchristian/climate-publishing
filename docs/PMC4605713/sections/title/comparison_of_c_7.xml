 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compared climatic and biotic velocity metrics using four methods. Firstly, we calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the metrics. Secondly, we used generalized-additive models [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref038">38</a>] to assess latitudinal gradients in climatic and biotic velocity. We assessed whether the relative intensity of climatic velocity was greatest in equatorial, temperate, or boreal regions, and whether biotic velocity mirrored or contrasted the latitudinal patterns shown by climatic velocity. If climatic and biotic velocity values peak in different latitudinal regions, this would imply that relative importance of exposure vs. sensitivity in producing climate-related vulnerability differs with latitude. Specifically, we hypothesized that climatic velocity would peak in boreal regions, which have experienced the greatest magnitude of anthropogenic climate change to date [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref039">39</a>], but that the generally narrower ranges of tropical species would cause the peak values of biotic velocity to occur outside the polar regions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thirdly, we compared the distribution of velocity values between latitudinal zones and between major climatic zones (defined in terms of the Koppen-Gieger system [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref040">40</a>]) using plots based on kernel density estimators and beanplots [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref041">41</a>]. We evaluated three distinct types of variation in the results. On a per-cell basis, we calculated variation (standard deviation) in velocity values between GCMs and between species within a taxa group. Taking the mean biotic velocities for each cell, we evaluated their variation across space to illustrate the degree of contrast between refugia and high velocity areas within a climate zone or latitudinal band. Taking the mean velocities for each species within a climatic zone, we evaluated variation between species within a taxa group to illustrate whether geographic patterns were general to most species or driven by a subset of highly vulnerable species.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, we analyzed the vulnerability of major protected areas (i.e., those of area &gt;200 km

Plotting the relative ranking of protected areas based on the four metrics (forward and backward climatic and biotic velocity) demonstrated how multiple metrics may be visually integrated and interpreted to support a multi-faceted threat assessment.
