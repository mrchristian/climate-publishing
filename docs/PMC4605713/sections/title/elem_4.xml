  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate data were downscaled to a 50km by 50km grid using locally weighted, lapse-rate-adjusted interpolation. Monthly climate data from 1961 to 1990 were then averaged to produce a base-line time period. Future climate projections were taken from ten general circulation model (GCM) simulations archived by the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3)(
   <a rid="pone.0140486.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s008">S1 Table</a>). Climate projections were averaged over a 30-year period from 2071 to 2100 and represent climates simulated for a mid-to-high (SRES A2) greenhouse-gas emissions scenario [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref021">21</a>]. Thirty-seven bioclimatic variables were developed from the primary climate data [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref022">22</a>] (
   <a rid="pone.0140486.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s009">S2 Table</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A mid-to-high emissions scenario (SRES A2) was selected because the recent global CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions trajectory has fallen at the high end of the range of projections used in IPCC scenarios [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref026">26</a>]. Use of previously-published niche models limited the analysis to CMIP3 data rather than the recently-released CMIP5 projections. However, because CMIP5 projections are an incremental advance over CMIP3 data [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref027">27</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref028">28</a>], this decision does not substantially limit the relevance of our results as a tool for threat assessment. Temperature projections from the SRES A2 scenario are intermediate to those of CMIP5 representative concentration pathways (RCP) 6.0 and 8.5 [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a direct estimate of climatic velocity, or the distance between a location and the nearest location with analogous climate in the future [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref007">7</a>]. Climate analogs were identified using multivariate Euclidean climate distance estimated from the first 5 axes of a principal components analysis of the 37 bioclimatic variables. Use of multivariate Euclidean distance based on PCA scores reduced the effect of collinearity between bioclimatic variables and approximated a Mahalanobis distance based on the original set of variables.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Principal components analysis of the 37 bioclimatic variables resulted in first and second PCA component dominated by temperature and precipitation, respectively. These two components captured 57.2% and 20.6% of total variance, respectively. The five components capturing greater than 2% of variance each, which cumulatively captured 91.4% of total variance, were used in the subsequent velocity calculations. We used equally spaced intervals to divide current and future climate space into multivariate bins. Because the width of each bin was maintained across all 5 PCA axes, the number of bins on each axis, and its importance in determining a climate analog, is approximately proportional to the variance explained by that axis.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The degree of similarity which constitutes an analogous climate type (i.e., the width of a climate bin) is a key parameter in derivation of analog-based velocity. In a two-dimensional plot of the first two PCA components, these bins can be visualized as rectangular areas with similar climate values in multivariate space. Given enough precision in measurements, no two grid cells will have the same climate value. As bin width widens and precision decreases, velocity values decrease to the point where information is lost because many areas show zero velocity (
   <a rid="pone.0140486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s001">S1A Fig</a>)[
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref007">7</a>]. Conversely, as bin width narrows past a certain threshold, the proportion of no-analog climates, which also hold limited information value, sharply increases (
   <a rid="pone.0140486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s001">S1B Fig</a>) [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref007">7</a>]. We found that a bin width of 2 PCA units optimized the information value of the resulting velocity maps by balancing loss of information due to excessively broad bins versus domination of the results by disappearing or no-analog climates due to excessively narrow bins (
   <a rid="pone.0140486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s001">S1 Fig</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each unique climate type (bin), we identified cells (sites or pixels) within that type under both current and projected climates. Then, we used fast approximate-nearest-neighbor algorithms (using the R package yaImpute [

This distance provided the basis for deriving forward climatic velocity. Additionally, for each future cell, we identified the nearest neighboring cell of the same type under current climate. This distance provided the basis for deriving backward climatic velocity [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref007">7</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cells for which no match can be found in the other time period represent cells which have velocities that extend beyond the analysis region. Although these areas could be assigned an arbitrarily high velocity value, this would obscure patterns in the velocity results. Therefore, the probability of disappearance of climate types (as well as of species; see below) was tabulated separately from calculations of climatic velocity. Disappearing or no-analog climates can also arise as an artifact of the arbitrary boundaries between climate bins. We incrementally offset bin boundaries over 100 replicated velocity calculations and averaged the results to eliminate this effect. We then averaged velocities from the ten GCMs to derive a mean velocity value.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biotic velocity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climatic niche models for the North and South American continents, at 50 km resolution, were drawn from a previously-published study [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref022">22</a>], which assessed the potential effects of climate change on distribution of 2954 vertebrate species (1818 birds, 723 mammals, and 413 amphibians) in the Western Hemisphere. Species distribution data were taken from digital range maps for birds [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref031">31</a>], mammals [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref032">32</a>] and amphibians (data available online, 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.globalamphibians.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.globalamphibians.org</span>). For birds, only breeding ranges were included. Range maps are scale-dependent abstractions of species distributions which overestimate species’ occurrences [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref033">33</a>]. However, they are useful in taxonomically comprehensive assessments where point locations of species’ occurrences are unavailable for a subset of the species considered [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref034">34</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref035">35</a>]. The 50 km resolution was chosen to strike a balance between inaccuracies due to applying a fine-resolution grid to relatively coarse resolution digital-range maps and inaccuracies due to mapping climate at too coarse a resolution. Niche models were developed using the same 37 bioclimatic variables used in deriving climatic velocity (
   <a rid="pone.0140486.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s009">S2 Table</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Niche models were built using random forest predictors, an ensemble-based machine-learning approach based on combining predictions from multiple classification or regression trees built using random subsets of the data and predictor variables [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref036">36</a>]. For each model, a threshold for predicting presence was determined using the receiver-operating characteristic curve with the assumption that correctly predicting a presence was as important as predicting an absence [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref037">37</a>]. Models for 2954 species were able to correctly predict at least 90% of the absences and 80% of the presences in the reserved test data sets. These models were then used to project areas that will likely be climatically suitable under the ten GCM projections of future climates.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated biotic velocity based on climatic niche model projections from each of the ten GCMs. To calculate forward velocity, we assigned each cell within the current range of the species a velocity based on the distance to the nearest cell of future climatically suitable habitat (see 
   <a rid="pone.0140486.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s007">S1 File</a> and

To calculate backward velocity, we assigned each cell within the future projected range of a species a velocity based on the distance to the nearest cell of current climatically suitable habitat. We averaged resultant velocities to derive a mean value for each of the three taxa groups (birds, mammals, and amphibians). For each cell, we also calculated the probability of a species disappearing at that site. We used probability rather than number of species disappearing at each site to reduce correlation of the metric with gradients in current species diversity.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of climatic and biotic velocity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compared climatic and biotic velocity metrics using four methods. Firstly, we calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the metrics. Secondly, we used generalized-additive models [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref038">38</a>] to assess latitudinal gradients in climatic and biotic velocity. We assessed whether the relative intensity of climatic velocity was greatest in equatorial, temperate, or boreal regions, and whether biotic velocity mirrored or contrasted the latitudinal patterns shown by climatic velocity. If climatic and biotic velocity values peak in different latitudinal regions, this would imply that relative importance of exposure vs. sensitivity in producing climate-related vulnerability differs with latitude. Specifically, we hypothesized that climatic velocity would peak in boreal regions, which have experienced the greatest magnitude of anthropogenic climate change to date [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref039">39</a>], but that the generally narrower ranges of tropical species would cause the peak values of biotic velocity to occur outside the polar regions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thirdly, we compared the distribution of velocity values between latitudinal zones and between major climatic zones (defined in terms of the Koppen-Gieger system [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref040">40</a>]) using plots based on kernel density estimators and beanplots [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref041">41</a>]. We evaluated three distinct types of variation in the results. On a per-cell basis, we calculated variation (standard deviation) in velocity values between GCMs and between species within a taxa group. Taking the mean biotic velocities for each cell, we evaluated their variation across space to illustrate the degree of contrast between refugia and high velocity areas within a climate zone or latitudinal band. Taking the mean velocities for each species within a climatic zone, we evaluated variation between species within a taxa group to illustrate whether geographic patterns were general to most species or driven by a subset of highly vulnerable species.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, we analyzed the vulnerability of major protected areas (i.e., those of area &gt;200 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>; data available from 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.protectedplanet.net/</span>) of the Americas based on the various velocity metrics, by calculating the mean of velocity values within the extent of the protected area. Plotting the relative ranking of protected areas based on the four metrics (forward and backward climatic and biotic velocity) demonstrated how multiple metrics may be visually integrated and interpreted to support a multi-faceted threat assessment.
