 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Metrics that synthesize the complex effects of climate change are essential tools for mapping future threats to biodiversity. As climate shifts over the coming decades, such metrics can help us predict which species are likely to adapt in place to new climatic conditions, disperse and establish in areas with newly suitable climate, or face the prospect of extirpation [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref001">1</a>]. Such information also allows us to evaluate whether specific sites, such as existing protected areas, will serve as refugia or face loss of species and consequent changes in ecosystem processes [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref002">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most commonly used of such metrics is the velocity of climate change, which estimates the speed at which species must migrate over the earth’s surface to maintain constant climatic conditions. As originally proposed, climatic velocity is derived by dividing the temporal rate of projected climate change by the current gradient of climate variability across a spatial neighborhood [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref003">3</a>]. This method, which has been termed “local” velocity [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref004">4</a>] (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g001">Fig 1A</a>), only considers spatial variability within the immediate neighborhood of a location. Consequently, the rate of migration necessary to maintain constant climate conditions may be underestimated in alpine and arctic regions if velocity vectors point toward climatic cul-de-sacs, i.e. by pointing beyond mountain tops or polar edges of continents [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref005">5</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref006">6</a>]. Secondly, velocity may approach infinity in flat areas, even if similar future climates are found just beyond the focal neighborhood.

 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of these factors, a metric based on the actual distance between a location and the location where a similar (analogous) climate will be found in the future forms a valuable complement to local velocity [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref004">4</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref007">7</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref008">8</a>]. Deriving such “analog-based” velocity (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g001">Fig 1B</a>) can be computationally challenging, because it requires a search over the entire extent of the data to identify the most spatially-proximate cell which is an analog of the focal cell based on the environmental attribute(s) of interest. However, recent advances in efficient nearest-neighbor search algorithms have made such global searches computationally feasible for high-resolution raster datasets [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref009">9</a>]. The shift of the search radius from a neighborhood to the entire extent of the data enhances the relevance of the velocity metric, especially for mobile species that may disperse over larger distances than can be evaluated in a neighborhood-based search.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, nearest-neighbor search allows calculation of both forward velocities (the distance from current climate locations to the nearest site with an analogous future climate; 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g002">Fig 2A</a>) and backward velocities (the distance from projected future climate cells back to analogous current climate locations; 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g002">Fig 2B</a>). At first glance, these two forms of velocity based on the same inputs appear to differ only in their opposing time directions. However, the two calculations can yield profoundly different results which provide contrasting but complementary information to support conservation of species and their populations. Forward velocity reflects the minimum distance an organism in the current landscape must migrate to maintain constant climate condition. Because forward velocity reflects the exposure of organisms to climate change, the metric is particularly relevant in assessing the conservation status of species and their populations under climate change. Forward velocity will often be high in alpine areas because reaching the nearest analogous future climate may require dispersal to distant higher elevation mountaintops (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g002">Fig 2A</a>, lower panel).

 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Backward velocity reflects the minimum distance, given the projected future conditions at a site, that a climatically-adapted organism would have to migrate to colonize the site. Backward velocity reflects the relative difficulty of species faces in colonizing newly suitable habitat via dispersal or gene flow (e.g., via pollen) [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref007">7</a>]. Backward velocity, unlike forward velocity, is generally low in alpine areas, because adapted organisms can reach the site from nearby downslope locations. Conversely, valley bottom habitat may lack nearby climate analogs, and organisms would have to travel longer distances to colonize these locally new habitat conditions (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g002">Fig 2B</a>, lower panel).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forward velocity measures the distance from a single source to multiple future destinations (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g002">Fig 2A</a>, top panel). Conversely, backward velocity considers the distance between disparate source locations and a single future destination (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g002">Fig 2B</a>, top panel). Therefore, the use of these two metrics in planning will typically imply a contrasting focus on species/populations (forward velocity) or sites (backward velocity). While species inhabiting a site with high forward velocity are potentially threatened with extinction, a site with high backward velocity is threatened with holding a depauperate complement of species adapted to its future climate, with consequent effects on ecosystem function and services.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distinction between local and analog-based velocity is also relevant for velocities based on projections from climatic niche models (a type of model based on correlations between species distributions and current climatic conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref010">10</a>]). A local metric, termed “bioclimatic” velocity [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref011">11</a>], can be calculated based on the modeled probability of species occurrence (inferring habitat suitability). This habitat suitability metric is treated as equivalent to a climate variable in local climatic velocity, in that velocity is derived by dividing the rate of change over time in a continuous habitat suitability metric by the rate of change in that metric within the local neighborhood (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g001">Fig 1C</a>). In contrast, an analog-based metric, termed “biotic velocity” [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref004">4</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref012">12</a>], represents the distance between a site and the nearest site projected to be climatically suitable for the species under future projected climates (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g001">Fig 1D</a>). The metric can be reported on a per-species basis or averaged across a taxa group. Because it is based on a binary classification of the landscape into suitable and unsuitable areas, biotic velocity sacrifices information on local habitat gradients in order to incorporate information on broad-scale patterns in range shifts.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies have determined that historical climatic velocity is correlated with past species range shifts [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref013">13</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref015">15</a>]. In contrast to historical studies, forward-looking comparisons rely on projected range shifts as a response variable, which imperfectly represents the actual pattern of future species movements. However, comparison of biotic and climatic velocity based on future climate projections is critical in informing planners as to whether the higher level of model complexity represented by climatic niche models results in qualitatively different threat patterns and conservation priorities. For example, a strategy for identification and conservation of refugia [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref016">16</a>] would be more complex if areas of low biotic velocity did not overlap with areas of low climatic velocity. In general, consideration of a suite of climate-related metrics results in more robust threat assessments than could a focus on any one measure in isolation [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref017">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate displacements derived from multiple bioclimatic variables show more complex and informative patterns than those shown by the magnitude of temperature change alone [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref018">18</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref020">20</a>]. We developed multivariate climatic velocity for North and South America based on a principal components analysis of 37 bioclimatic variables, using data derived from ten GCMs for the SRES A2 emissions scenario [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref021">21</a>] (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s008">S1 Table</a>). We developed biotic velocity from multivariate climatic niche models for 2954 terrestrial species (1818 birds, 723 mammals and 413 amphibians) based on a previously-published analysis that projected shifts in the geographic distribution of climatic suitability from a current historical (1961–1990) to a future (2071–2100) habitat time period, based on the ten GCM projections [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref022">22</a>]. The hemispheric extent allowed us to compare the two metrics across a diverse set of biomes that vary widely in their climatic and biogeographic attributes. We also compared the distribution of disappearing climates and species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have mapped local or neighborhood-based climatic velocity [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref003">3</a>] and disappearing climates [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref023">23</a>] at a global scale, as well as distance to future analogous climates in Europe [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref024">24</a>]. Analog-based biotic velocity has been assessed between current and paleoclimates for North American trees [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref012">12</a>], and between current and future projected climates for Western Hemisphere mammals [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref025">25</a>]. Local bioclimatic velocity has been analyzed for California tree species [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref011">11</a>]. In this study, we provide the first comparison of analog-based climatic and biotic velocity between current and projected future climate over a broad taxonomic and geographic scope.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because analog-based velocity searches beyond a local neighborhood (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g001">Fig 1</a>), the metric effectively integrates factors that influence climate at a range of spatial scales, including local topographic gradients, regional topographic position, and location in relationship to continental margins and synoptic weather systems. In this study, we use two examples to demonstrate how such information on broad-scale patterns of exposure and sensitivity enhances the relevance of the velocity metric to conservation planning. Firstly, we use analog-based velocity to evaluate how climatic vulnerability varies with latitude. We ask whether potential threats are greater in equatorial, temperate, or boreal regions, and whether these threats derive primarily from the magnitude of climate change or the differential sensitivity of taxa in different regions. Secondly, we demonstrate how to integrate results from a suite of complementary velocity metrics, using an example focusing on climate-related threats to protected areas of the Western Hemisphere. By placing the sometimes confusing variety of previously-proposed velocity metrics in a coherent framework, and demonstrating how they can be integrated to inform a multi-faceted threat assessment, we hope to stimulate their more widespread use in the increasing number of planning efforts focused on conserving landscape-scale climate resilience and adaptation potential.
