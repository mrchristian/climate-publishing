 <div class="title">List of wetlands used in analysis.</div>
 <p>Under site locations, MRNP is Mount Rainier National Park, NCNP is North Cascades National Park, and OLYM is Olympic National Park. *Our classifications are based on the long-term dynamics of wetlands from the VIC runs. As a result, some of our classifications at Mazama Ridge differ from Girdner and Larsonâ€™s classification from the very dry summer of 1992.</p>
