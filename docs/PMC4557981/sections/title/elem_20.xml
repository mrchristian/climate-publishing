 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found consistent projected effects of climate change on all classes of wetlands, including earlier drawdown, a more rapid recession rate in summer, and reduced minimum water levels (Figs 
  <a rid="pone.0136385.g008" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0136385.g008">8</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0136385.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0136385.s006">S6</a>). Overall, water levels in ephemeral or intermediate wetlands are most sensitive to climate change (
  <a rid="pone.0136385.g008" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0136385.g008">Fig 8A, 8B, 8E and 8F</a>). In ephemeral or intermediate wetlands, the effects of earlier drawdown, more rapid summer recession rate, and reduced minimum water levels result in a longer dry season in summer (Figs 
  <a rid="pone.0136385.g008" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0136385.g008">8A, 8B, 8E and 8F</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0136385.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0136385.s006">S6C</a>). Results for perennial and permanent wetlands also showed earlier drawdown and/or reduced water levels in future climates (Figs 
  <a rid="pone.0136385.g008" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0136385.g008">8C, 8D, 8G and 8H</a>, and 
  <a rid="pone.0136385.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0136385.s006">S6A and S6B</a>). Our projections also revealed variations in the magnitude of changes that were dependent on wetland type and location.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These climate-induced shifts in hydrologic behavior across all types of montane wetlands in our study for which we had site specific models support the hypothesis that climate change will force transitions among wetland types (
  <a rid="pone.0136385.g009" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0136385.g009">Fig 9</a>). By the 2080s, 58% of intermediate wetlands are projected to become ephemeral hydroperiod wetlands (17/31 sites), whereas 22% of perennial wetlands are projected to become intermediate wetlands (7/32 sites) and 3% to become ephemeral wetlands (1/32 sites) (
  <a rid="pone.0136385.g009" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0136385.g009">Fig 9B</a>). Thirty-two percent of permanent wetlands are projected to become perennial (12/38 sites) (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considered at the landscape scale, the projected effects of climate change on future probabilities of drying of intermediate wetlands in mountainous areas of Washington vary geographically but increase overall in higher elevation regions (
  <a rid="pone.0136385.g010" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0136385.g010">Fig 10</a>). Lowland areas are typically below the soil moisture threshold every year, and the probability of drying (by this measure) does not change in these areas, thus our model is not appropriate for assessment of lower elevation regions (grey areas on the maps). Similarly, many mid-low elevation regions show little change or even a small shift towards becoming wetter (light green and purple regions on 
  <a rid="pone.0136385.g010" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0136385.g010">Fig 10C</a>). At higher elevations, both along the crest of the Washington Cascades and in the Olympic Mountains, the probability of drying for intermediate wetlands changes substantially. Under the 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century climate, many cells had a probability of drying of 0.5 or lower for intermediate wetlands (
  <a rid="pone.0136385.g010" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0136385.g010">Fig 10A</a>). By the 2080s, the projected probability of drying is greater than 0.8 for all but a few model cells (
  <a rid="pone.0136385.g010" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0136385.g010">Fig 10B</a>). The largest changes in probability of drying were simulated for cells that historically represented the wettest regions in the model domain.
