  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We define wetlands broadly as any area where shallow surface water collects. Wetlands exist on a hydrologic continuum and many different methods of wetland classification exist (e.g. Cowardin, hydrogeomorphic (HGM)). We use a simple hydrologic classification scheme based on hydroperiod and wetland sensitivity to climate variability to characterize four ecologically relevant types of wetlands–ephemeral, intermediate, perennial, and permanent (
   <a rid="pone.0136385.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0136385.t001">Table 1</a>). This approach is similar to other hydrologic classifications based on hydroperiod [
   <a rid="pone.0136385.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref033">33</a>] and volumetric water loss [
   <a rid="pone.0136385.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref034">34</a>] in that it relates inherently continuous hydrologic variation in water permanence and periodicity to more discrete ecological thresholds determined by species’ development and life history requirements (e.g. number of months or years that ponds must hold water for an insect, frog, or salamander to develop and metamorphose).

   <span class="bold">ephemeral wetlands</span> dry completely or drop, on average, below 3% of their maximum water levels. Ephemeral wetlands are functionally dry for most aquatic species in most years, but may have water for the entire summer in unusually wet periods.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected detailed data on wetland hydrology (wetland depths and spatial extent) for 121 montane wetlands through in situ physical monitoring (3–6 site visits over the course of the summer and fall of 2012) in Olympic National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and North Cascades National Park (Tables 
   <a rid="pone.0136385.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0136385.t002">2</a> and 
   <a rid="pone.0136385.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0136385.s007">S1</a>). Field permits for hydrologic monitoring were granted by the National Park Service (Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades National Parks). In a subset of wetlands, we also estimated wetland depths using iButton temperature dataloggers. To do so, we installed iButtons along transects from the edge of the wetland to the deepest accessible point in the wetland. We identified the date at which wetland water levels dropped below each iButton based on changes in the variance in temperature (measured every two hours). Because air temperatures fluctuate more dramatically than water temperatures, it is possible to compare temperatures of iButtons along each transect to iButtons placed in the open air adjacent to the wetland to determine when the iButton was submerged or exposed to the air. Our physical depth measurements validated the estimates of water level derived from the iButton transects. This larger 2012 dataset supplemented several smaller historical datasets that we also used in building the models. These included 1) measured wetland water depths for 7 montane wetlands in Olympic National Park from the summer of 2000, 2) wetland water volume estimates for 10 montane wetlands in Mount Rainier National Park from June through September 1992 [

For given input data including temperature, precipitation, wind, vapor pressure, net incoming longwave and shortwave radiation, and air pressure, the VIC hydrological model simulates daily water balance variables such as snowpack, evapotranspiration, runoff, baseflow and soil moisture in three soil layers comprising the first several meters of soil. Simulations at each VIC grid cell cover an extended historical time period (water-years (i.e. October 1 to September 30) 1916–2012 for the PNW and 1916–2010 for CA). We used these water balance variables to develop empirical regression models of wetland response as described below and to hindcast historical variability of water levels in wetlands over 97 (PNW) and 95 years (CA) (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a first step, we used the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s R) to identify the strongest relationships between observed wetland water level at each site and a suite of daily water balance variables that were input to, or output from, the VIC models, including precipitation, evaporation, runoff, snow-water equivalent, and simulated soil moisture in the three different layers. Secondly, we constructed empirical models of wetland response by fitting regression equations to observed wetland water levels (volumes or depths) using the best-correlated water balance variable. We used the R (version 3.2.0) packages “stats” and “hydroGOF” to develop regression models and generate model statistics [
   <a rid="pone.0136385.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref044">44</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0136385.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref045">45</a>]. Because montane wetlands are relatively undisturbed by human changes in land use, when making future projections we assumed that the fitted regression relationships between wetland response and the soil moisture of the best-correlated water balance variable will not change with time. We developed a regression model using only observed data during drawdown periods because we did not have enough observed data during the rapid refill seasons to develop robust regression models for these. Also, for this system, the ecological consequences of altered timing of wetland drawdown and drying are greater than shifting timing of wetland refill, so we focused on the drawdown cycle for this reason as well.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For most Mount Rainier, Olympic, and North Cascades sites, we had only a single year of data from which to fit the regression models. However, when multiple-years of observations were available (e.g. for some sites in Mount Rainier and Olympic National Park and for all sites in Oregon and California), we investigated the uncertainty in the projections when fitting to a single year of data. For Oregon and California sites that showed similar gradual drawdown patterns for observed years, we fitted a separate regression model for each individual year of multiple years of observations, developed simulations for all years using each of these models, and then calculated the squared correlation coefficient (R
   <span class="sup">2</span>) using all observations and the corresponding simulations for each model. We then used the single-year regression model showing the highest squared correlation coefficient (R
   <span class="sup">2</span>) for all the available data to simulate historical wetland response and the associated climate-change response. We used the regression models fitted to other years to estimate the uncertainty in the simulations due to uncertainty in the regression parameters for individual years. For the Willamette National Forest site, for example, the squared correlation coefficient (R
   <span class="sup">2</span>) for the three regression models using 2003, 2005 and 2006 data to train the regression models, was 0.49, 0.88 and 0.75, respectively. Therefore, we used the regression model fitted on the 2005 observed data to simulate the historical response and used the regression models for years 2003 and 2006 to estimate the uncertainty of the simulation due to uncertainty in the regression fit.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Mount Rainier and Olympic National Park sites with two years of observed data presented somewhat different drawdown patterns between years in response to different weather conditions. For example, one site in ONP showed gradual drawdown for year 2012 but, intermittent drawdown and frequent partial refill events for 2000. Thus, we developed a regression model using the earlier year’s data (e.g. 2000 data for Olympic National Park and 1992 for Mount Rainier), which had a greater number of observations and showed more dynamic changes in water levels. We then used the 2012 data from both regions to validate the regression models in the context of potentially different patterns of drawdown and refill across years. We used root mean squared error (RMSE) to evaluate how the regression model developed using the earlier year’s data performed to simulate the 2012 data.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To simulate potential future changes in water dynamics of individual montane wetlands in the PNW, we used simulated climate from the ECHAM5 general circulation model (GCM) forced by the A1B emissions scenario, which approximates the average conditions simulated for the region by ten different GCMs forced by the same emissions scenario. Climate projections were downscaled with the Hybrid Delta (HD) method described in detail in Appendix A of Tohver et al. (2014) [
   <a rid="pone.0136385.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref042">42</a>]. Briefly, the HD method uses quantile mapping techniques to produce the transformed monthly observed climate data (water-years 1916–2006; a 91-year time series) in response to 30 years of monthly GCM projections for two future time periods: the 2040s (2030–2059) and the 2080s (2070–2099). The future monthly values are then used to rescale the daily values from the observed month to produce a future daily time series. As a result, the HD approach provides 91 years of observed variability ("1916–2006") for each future time period, and is directly comparable to the historical record on an event basis from 1916–2006. Note that for historical runs we extended the VIC runs from 1916–2006 to 1916–2012 in order to use field data obtained in 2012. However, for climate scenarios we used existing data developed by Hamlet et al. (2013) [
   <a rid="pone.0136385.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref017">17</a>] that have 91 years of observed variability, projected for future time periods. For landscape scale projections of the probability of drying for intermediate wetlands in Washington, we used an ensemble of ten climate change projections from 10 different GCMs forced by the A1B scenarios [
   <a rid="pone.0136385.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref017">17</a>]. We report the average of these results.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For California, we used the ECHAM5 A1B scenario based on the Distributed Delta (DD) downscaling approach that is described by Littell et al. (2011) [
   <a rid="pone.0136385.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref046">46</a>] and Salathé et al. (2013) [
   <a rid="pone.0136385.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref043">43</a>]. Although, ideally, we would have used data downscaled with the same approach for the California sites as we did for the Oregon and Washington sites, these data were the ones readily available from previous studies. Similar to the HD approach, the DD scenarios construct a 95-year time series for two future time periods, which have the same number of years as the observations used in the downscaling. Although there are some differences in details between this downscaling method and the HD approach described above (e.g. length of record, method by which the changes in climate are applied to the historical time series), for our use here these differences are not particularly important. Both methods incorporate the spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation changes from GCMs, and changes in the central tendency of projected temperature and precipitation in each region are similar in each case.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the average minimum wetland water level for both the historical runs and two future scenarios with time series behavior derived from the historical period. The average minimum wetland water levels were used to classify wetland types and evaluate the impacts of climate change on minimum wetland water levels.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To project changes in the distribution and behavior of wetlands at landscape scales, we investigated a threshold for wetland drying (when ponds reach 0% of maximum water level) that can be applied generally across different locations and soil types. To do so, we evaluated the relationship between wetland drying and “field capacity.” Field capacity is the volumetric soil water content of soil that is partly saturated, but drains very slowly by gravity. This metric relates directly to our best predictors (soil moistures, as discussed below). We converted absolute soil moisture values generated by the VIC model to the field capacities that vary with soil type. We then compared simulated soil moisture with wetland water levels for intermediate wetlands at Mount Rainier and Olympic National Parks to find a threshold below which wetlands tend to dry out. Finally, we used the mean threshold of drying across regions and soil types as a proxy for intermediate wetland drying for each VIC grid cell in the landscape scale analysis.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calculate the probability of drying in each cell we counted the number of water-years for which the magnitude of soil moisture in the bottom soil layer was less than the drying threshold, and then divided by the total number of water-years. Thus the probability of wetland drying ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating more frequent wetland drying. We calculated the probability of wetland drying for the historical run and for all ten Hybrid Delta A1B scenarios for the 2080s, averaging the latter results for presentation in the plots. We then estimated the change in the probability of wetland drying by subtracting the probability of wetland drying for the historical run from that for the average value for the 2080s, with a positive value indicating an increase in the probability of drying for the 2080s.</p>
