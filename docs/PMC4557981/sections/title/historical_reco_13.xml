 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the average minimum wetland water level for both the historical runs and two future scenarios with time series behavior derived from the historical period. The average minimum wetland water levels were used to classify wetland types and evaluate the impacts of climate change on minimum wetland water levels.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To project changes in the distribution and behavior of wetlands at landscape scales, we investigated a threshold for wetland drying (when ponds reach 0% of maximum water level) that can be applied generally across different locations and soil types. To do so, we evaluated the relationship between wetland drying and “field capacity.” Field capacity is the volumetric soil water content of soil that is partly saturated, but drains very slowly by gravity. This metric relates directly to our best predictors (soil moistures, as discussed below). We converted absolute soil moisture values generated by the VIC model to the field capacities that vary with soil type. We then compared simulated soil moisture with wetland water levels for intermediate wetlands at Mount Rainier and Olympic National Parks to find a threshold below which wetlands tend to dry out. Finally, we used the mean threshold of drying across regions and soil types as a proxy for intermediate wetland drying for each VIC grid cell in the landscape scale analysis.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calculate the probability of drying in each cell we counted the number of water-years for which the magnitude of soil moisture in the bottom soil layer was less than the drying threshold, and then divided by the total number of water-years. Thus the probability of wetland drying ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating more frequent wetland drying. We calculated the probability of wetland drying for the historical run and for all ten Hybrid Delta A1B scenarios for the 2080s, averaging the latter results for presentation in the plots. We then estimated the change in the probability of wetland drying by subtracting the probability of wetland drying for the historical run from that for the average value for the 2080s, with a positive value indicating an increase in the probability of drying for the 2080s.</p>
