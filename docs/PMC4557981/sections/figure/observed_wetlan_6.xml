  <div class="title">Observed wetland water level for year 1992 (a-c) and for year 2012 (d-f) for ponds at Mount Rainier National Park compared with the simulated wetland water levels using the regression model that were developed based on 1992 observation.</div>
  <p>Solid circles show observed data that are used for developing regression model and/or for calculating R
   <span class="sup">2</span> values and open circles are the other observed data. RMSE is the root mean squared error, which allows comparison of model fit for the two datasets.
