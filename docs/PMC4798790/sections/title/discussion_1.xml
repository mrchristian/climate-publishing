 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">American instructors in the earth and space sciences who cover “controversial” topics in science must be aware of the potential for controversy and respond respectfully to engage students, parents, the community, and their peers (
  <a rid="b26-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26-jmbe-17-107">26</a>). Although environmental concerns receive significant public and media attention, the public has a poor understanding of the science in general, especially as these topics often require drawing upon information from multiple disciplines (
  <a rid="b52-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b52-jmbe-17-107">52</a>). Several key parallels exist between evolution and climate change, scientifically and in terms of public perception. Beyond discussing extinction or evolution, the topics share many similarities in how they are presented to students. Citing the teaching of evolution, Hermann (
  <a rid="b23-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23-jmbe-17-107">23</a>) calls upon several key concepts (noted in italics), which we can extrapolate for these purposes to the teaching and learning of climate change:

    <a rid="b40-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40-jmbe-17-107">40</a>) is an ideological issue in a country that values ideology strongly. Herein, we acknowledge the nature of the debate being limited to “controversial” in the public eye, which classifies it as a socioscientific debate, not a scientific one (
    <a rid="b57-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57-jmbe-17-107">57</a>). The major distinction between climate change and evolution is the nature of the sides—evolution is disagreeable with certain religious groups and climate change finds opposition primarily in the political arena.

    <span class="italic">Conceptual frameworks for both span multiple scientific</span> [and non-scientific] 
    <span class="italic">disciplines.</span> The teaching of evolution relies on the conceptual understanding of several sub-disciplines. On a larger scale, climate change and its implications require an even greater diversity of knowledge of many fields to understand the vast effects, even outside of the traditional science disciplines, with far-reaching implications into our everyday lives (

    <span class="italic">There is debate, disagreement, and uncertainty between opposing sides.</span> Primarily, we encounter the “sides” of this debate in the media and political arenas. In both situations, the press plays a key role in influencing public opinion to perpetuate these debates. Although outside of our primary focus, legislature and politics often complicate the interactions of civics and education. For example, several states (Louisiana, South Dakota, and Tennessee) have legislature-mandated laws concerning the teaching of climate change, including aspects such as teaching it as a controversy (
    <a rid="b26-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26-jmbe-17-107">26</a>). Creating a circular argument, governmental policy is driven ideally by constituent opinion and may be a direct reflection of citizen opinions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the literature, a number of instructional methods exist for engaging students in both general and controversial science topics. With evolution, the instructor’s approach can fit into one of four general categories: advocacy, affirmative neutrality, procedural neutrality, and avoidance (
  <a rid="b23-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23-jmbe-17-107">23</a>). These include, respectively, arguing for a side, presenting several positions, allowing students to present sides from resources, and omitting the conversation (
  <a rid="b23-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23-jmbe-17-107">23</a>). Regardless of the instructor’s choices relative to the topic, the educational approaches for evolution span a representative distribution of methods, including a selection from the nature of science (
  <a rid="b11-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11-jmbe-17-107">11</a>, 
  <a rid="b24-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24-jmbe-17-107">24</a>, 
  <a rid="b34-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34-jmbe-17-107">34</a>, 
  <a rid="b35-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35-jmbe-17-107">35</a>, 
  <a rid="b37-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37-jmbe-17-107">37</a>, 
  <a rid="b42-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b42-jmbe-17-107">42</a>, 
  <a rid="b55-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55-jmbe-17-107">55</a>), geological time (
  <a rid="b11-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11-jmbe-17-107">11</a>, 
  <a rid="b30-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b30-jmbe-17-107">30</a>), as well as questioning, case studies, and law (
  <a rid="b20-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20-jmbe-17-107">20</a>, 
  <a rid="b38-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38-jmbe-17-107">38</a>). Relatively understated in the literature are studies evaluating the efficacy of newer active learning methods such as citizen science with respect to controversial topics. Among those present, selected examples generally include teaching tools for inquiry or active learning, for students (
  <a rid="b8-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8-jmbe-17-107">8</a>, 
  <a rid="b9-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9-jmbe-17-107">9</a>, 
  <a rid="b17-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17-jmbe-17-107">17</a>), or teacher training (
  <a rid="b14-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14-jmbe-17-107">14</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the classroom, for example, science educators often have found success in teaching controversial topics (e.g., evolution) to traditionally non-receptive audiences by developing an understanding of the nature of science (
  <a rid="b47-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b47-jmbe-17-107">47</a>) and the value of the scientific process. As science teaching continues to move toward many established and/or validated active learning methods in the classroom (
  <a rid="b21-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21-jmbe-17-107">21</a>), we must engage students in new ways on key issues, especially those of socioscientific controversy (
  <a rid="b2-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2-jmbe-17-107">2</a>). Issues-based teaching favors a science curriculum that politicizes students and promotes empowerment through civic participation, decision-making, and action (
  <a rid="b43-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43-jmbe-17-107">43</a>, 
  <a rid="b44-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44-jmbe-17-107">44</a>, 
  <a rid="b57-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57-jmbe-17-107">57</a>). One method of engaging people in controversial topics is to use various forms of communication, such as conversations, argumentation (
  <a rid="b19-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19-jmbe-17-107">19</a>, 
  <a rid="b28-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28-jmbe-17-107">28</a>), cognitive conflict (
  <a rid="b45-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b45-jmbe-17-107">45</a>), and citizen/expert panel simulations (
  <a rid="b3-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3-jmbe-17-107">3</a>, 
  <a rid="b10-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10-jmbe-17-107">10</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To expand on interactive student experiences, citizen science projects have the ability to engage students and the larger community alike. Social and ethical issues offer students opportunities “to attach personal meaning to science concepts, theories and processes, and enable investigations that are closer to students’ daily existence” (
  <a rid="b58-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58-jmbe-17-107">58</a>). This may enable educators to bring focus to important ideas by engaging students through emotional and intellectual stimulation, transforming otherwise distant topics into those central to their everyday lives (
  <a rid="b58-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58-jmbe-17-107">58</a>). Although both evolution and climate change include some current citizen science projects, a continued expansion may be an educational opportunity for students of all ages, from the classroom to the community. These projects can expand on the use of inquiry in the classroom to create large-scale research projects. Additionally, students may gain a greater appreciation of science by being involved in areas of non-simulated research, as opposed to the traditional “cookbook” labs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When considering the use of a citizen-science approach for climate awareness and education, a primary advantage is the past success demonstrated in citizen science. Several ongoing citizen science projects mentioned, including, for example, those of The Cornell Lab (
  <a rid="b13-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13-jmbe-17-107">13</a>), have been shown to generate large amounts of scientifically valuable data while educating participants in the process of science and the specific areas of investigation (
  <a rid="b6-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6-jmbe-17-107">6</a>). In North America alone, there may be more than 200 research projects (
  <a rid="b12-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12-jmbe-17-107">12</a>), and several projects (notably eBird and Zooniverse) have led to scores of publications in many fields (
  <a rid="b7-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7-jmbe-17-107">7</a>). Additionally, climate change project examples span a range from active participation in parks (
  <a rid="b41-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41-jmbe-17-107">41</a>) to volunteering computer processing time (
  <a rid="b53-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53-jmbe-17-107">53</a>). Although some of these projects have turned into published scholarly works, the field of citizen science as a whole is underdeveloped and seen as an educational opportunity (
  <a rid="b6-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6-jmbe-17-107">6</a>). Additional opportunities exist to evaluate the educational aspects of these projects, as these remain understudied compared with other teaching techniques (
  <a rid="b51-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51-jmbe-17-107">51</a>) such as those used in active learning or inquiry-based approaches.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, studies focusing on the research and educational benefits of citizen-science projects for studying local and global impacts of climate change appear to be relatively underdeveloped in the literature. This represents an opportunity, especially for science education researchers. Beyond the possibilities of data generation and publications for the coordinating researchers and organizations, a key aspect of the citizen-science project is the education of nonscientists in how science works, as well as specific, project-related content (
  <a rid="b6-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6-jmbe-17-107">6</a>, 
  <a rid="b51-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51-jmbe-17-107">51</a>). Especially in those more controversial topics, public perception relies strongly on the overall perception of science. With citizen science, we can effect change through engagement to develop an appreciation for science in everyday life.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the principles of citizen science, students of all ages can be involved in research. Although ecology, evolution, and climate change are vastly interconnected, such studies have yet to show a strong presence in the science education literature. Searches of popular academic literature sites, for example Web of Science and ERIC Social Sciences database, with Boolean key words “citizen science AND education AND climate change” reveal approximately 50 or fewer total results, most of which relate to developing a productive or knowledgeable citizenry, instead of a citizen-science research project. The limited results show a large unexplored niche in educational research for the integration of citizen science in the curriculum and subsequent studies for efficacy or validation. In the case of climate change, this integration would be possible across many disciplines, especially with established topics of socioscientific controversy.</p>
