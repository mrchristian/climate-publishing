 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As demonstrated in several observational studies, there has been an overall intensification of daily precipitation extremes as a result of global warming, although the available data has limited geographic coverage, and there are large regional variations in the observed trends. Much of the characterization of projected changes in precipitation extremes comes from climate models that use parameterized moist convection, but these are not expected to be reliable for precipitation extremes that are primarily convective in nature (for example, in the tropics or for certain events in summer in the extratropics). As a result, simulations that use cloud-system resolving models or superparameterizations are becoming increasingly important to research in this area. Even when convective dynamics are resolved, precipitation extremes at short durations have been found to be sensitive to the parameterization of cloud and precipitation microphysics [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contributions from changes in thermodynamics, dynamics, and precipitation efficiency have all been found to be important for changes in precipitation extremes in at least some situations in modeling studies. The thermodynamic contribution is the easiest to understand and always gives an intensification with warming. There is some basic understanding of dynamical contributions at the large scale from the omega equation (“
  <a rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec5">Extratropical Precipitation Extremes</a>”) and also at the convective scale in the case of RCE (“
  <a rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec3">Theory</a>” and “
  <a rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec9">Duration of Precipitation Extremes</a>”), but only a few studies have focussed on the role of mesoscale convective organization in precipitation extremes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Precipitation extremes associated with particular dynamical regimes or particular precipitation types may respond differently to climate warming and are deserving of special attention. As discussed in the “
  <a rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec7">Orographic Precipitation Extremes</a>” section, recent idealized studies of orographic precipitation extremes have found that fractional increases are larger on the climatological leeward side than on the windward side, and further work is needed to relate this to more realistic modeling studies and observations. Similarly, snowfall extremes behave quite differently from rainfall extremes because they tend to occur near an optimal temperature that is unaffected by climate warming. Further work is needed to understand the specific responses of lake-effect and high-elevation snowfall extremes, as well as changes in the frequency of hail and ice storms [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Characterizing the dependence of changes in precipitation extremes on duration is of importance for impacts, and this is particularly challenging for subdaily durations. Much research has focussed on precipitation accumulated over fixed time periods as discussed in the “
  <a rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec9">Duration of Precipitation Extremes</a>” section. An alternative approach is to consider properties of contiguous precipitation events that are defined based on when non-zero precipitation begins and ends [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. Consideration of the amount of precipitation in a given event (the event depth) may be advantageous because observed distributions of event depths exhibit a power law range [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>] and thus, their response to climate change may be relatively simple to characterize.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily precipitation extremes in the tropics seem to be more sensitive to climate warming than those in the extratropics, as suggested by results from both rain-gauge observations (“
  <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">Observed Changes in Precipitation Extremes</a>”) and climate-model projections constrained using satellite observations (“
  <a rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec6">Tropical Precipitation Extremes</a>”). One possible cause is a more positive dynamical contribution in the tropics than the extratropics. Changes in extratropical eddy kinetic energy are relatively modest and can be either positive or negative depending on the season and hemisphere [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>], whereas increases in the frequency of the most intense tropical cyclones are expected as the climate warms [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>], and tropical cyclones contribute substantially to off-equatorial precipitation extremes in the current climate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Furthermore, increases in the activity of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and convectively coupled equatorial Kelvin waves have been found in simulations with conventional and superparameterized climate models [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. The influence of these potential dynamical changes on the aggregate statistics of tropical precipitation extremes remains to be assessed.
