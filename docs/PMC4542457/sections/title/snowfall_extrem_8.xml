 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in snowfall extremes have received relatively little research attention, party because of the difficulties in producing long-term records of snowfall. Observational studies of daily snowfall extremes have been regional in nature and have found large interdecadal variability with, for example, no long-term trend for Canada [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>] but more frequent extreme snowstorms in recent decades in the eastern two thirds of the USA [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Studies using different metrics have reached different conclusions as to whether there are more heavy snowfall events in anomalously warm or cold years or seasons in the USA [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Physically, snowfall extremes are expected to be affected by climate warming through both increases in saturation vapor pressures and changes in the frequency of occurrence of temperatures below the rain-snow transition temperature. A simple asymptotic theory of snowfall extremes has been developed based on the temperature dependencies of precipitation extremes and the rain-snow transition [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>•]. According to the simple theory, snowfall extremes tend to occur near an optimal temperature of roughly −2 °C when snowfall is measured by liquid water equivalent. The optimal temperature arises because saturation vapor pressures increase with temperature whereas the fraction of precipitation that falls as snow reduces sharply at surface temperatures near freezing. When snowfall is measured by depth of snow, the optimal temperature is lower (roughly −4 °C) because the variation of snow density with temperature must also be taken into account. For an infinitesimal climate warming, the intensity of snowfall extremes decreases for climatological-mean temperatures above the optimal temperature and increases for climatological-mean temperatures below it. Furthermore, fractional changes in high percentiles of snowfall are smaller the higher the percentile considered (unlike for rainfall extremes), and fractional changes in the intensity of the most extreme events tend to be relatively small. There may still be large fractional decreases in snowfall extremes with warming in regions with climatologically mild temperatures, and changes in the frequency of exceeding a fixed high threshold of snowfall may still be substantial.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Snowfall extremes in simulations with global climate models from CMIP5 behave similarly to the simple theory for sufficiently extreme statistics [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>•], although the climatological temperature below which snowfall extremes intensify is lower than the simple theory predicts. The response of snowfall extremes is similar in the subset of models that most realistically simulate Arctic sea ice [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>•], the decline of which has been hypothesized to affect midlatitude weather extremes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regional climate-model simulations exhibit large fractional decreases in maximum winter daily snowfall over much of western Europe, but little change or increases in other parts of Europe that are climatologically colder [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>]. As in the simple theory and in global climate-model simulations, there is a strong link in regional simulations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>] and downscaled global simulations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>] between the changes in snowfall extremes and the local climatological temperature in the control climate.
