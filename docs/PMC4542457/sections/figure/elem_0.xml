  <p>Sensitivities of observed annual-maximum daily precipitation over land (
   <span class="italic">solid lines with circles</span>; 
   <span class="italic">dotted lines</span> show the 90 % confidence interval) in 15° latitude bands relative to 
   <span class="bold">a</span> global-mean surface temperature or 
   <span class="bold">b</span> mean surface temperature over the 15° latitude band. Precipitation is from HadEX2, sensitivities are calculated for grid boxes with at least 30 annual values, and the median sensitivity is plotted for each 15° latitude band. Temperatures are over land and ocean from NOAA MLOST, and for 
   <span class="bold">b</span> the temperature time series were smoothed with a 9-year running-mean filter
