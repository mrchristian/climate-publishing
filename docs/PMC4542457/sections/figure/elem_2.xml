   <span class="bold">a</span> The 99.99th percentile of precipitation for different durations (instantaneous, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, and daily) in simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium with a cloud-system resolving model at selected mean surface-air temperatures as given in the legend. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> The sensitivity of the 99.99th percentile of precipitation to mean surface air temperature changes for the same temperatures shown in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>). The natural logarithm of the 99.99th percentile of precipitation as a function of mean surface-air temperature from ten simulations is linearly interpolated to a uniform grid in temperature and sensitivities (% K
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) are calculated as the change for a 3-K warming
