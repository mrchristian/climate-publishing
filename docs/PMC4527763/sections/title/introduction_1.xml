 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Views on climate change and policy relating to climate change in the Australian population are extremely diverse [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref001">1</a>]. In forming their views, people are influenced by many factors, including both situational variables and their own socio-economic and socio-political status [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref002">2</a>]. In this paper we focus on religious affiliation as a potential determinant of attitudes to climate change and climate change policy.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research conducted, principally in the United States (US) and Europe, has indicated that religious affiliation is a key factor to take into account in developing climate change policy and designing messages about policy [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref003">3</a>]. Based on an examination of teachings of nine major religions, covering issues such as other-person centeredness and environmental stewardship, Posas [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref004">4</a>] argued strongly that religions from Bahá’í to Buddhism and from Islam to Christianity should be able to influence their members to bring an ethical dimension which is sympathetic to climate change policy. White [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref005">5</a>] contended that there is a link between a Judeo-Christian perspective and a desire for dominion over nature, and that it was this dominion attitude which explained the scale of environmental destruction in the modern world. This dominion perspective has its basis in Genesis 1:26, ‘Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground”‘. In the US, a number of studies have revealed that this perspective manifests itself in a conservative Christianity effect, under which those who have a strong literal interpretation of the bible have a lower concern about the environment and a stronger belief in their own efficacy in controlling outcomes (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref006">6</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref007">7</a>]). This effect has a considerable influence when measuring the overall level of denial of climate change and the perceived need for policy. While clearly embedded in this discussion are the theological positions of the major religions, our focus throughout this paper is on climate change attitudes and behavior of those claiming affiliation with particular religious groups.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The literature also reveals that there are important differences between countries in the influence that religious affiliation has on ways of looking at climate change issues [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref008">8</a>]. This fact points to a need to consider the religious issues within a particular country context. There has been little attention given to these issues in Australia, and consequently one objective of the current paper is to examine how religious make-up affects attitudes and behavior in relation to climate change and climate change policy. Moreover, there are important features of the Australian situation that suggest that it is a country worthy of study. Dramatic societal change will be required there to achieve substantial carbon emission reductions. Although it is only a moderate carbon emitter in aggregate terms (ranked 17
  <span class="sup">th</span> in the world), in per capita terms it is the world’s second highest emitter [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref009">9</a>]. Also it is particularly dependent on the coal economy and will require considerable structural change to progress towards a low-carbon economy. These considerations mean that in future Australia could be an indicator of global progress on combating climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted an online survey of 1,927 Australians, designed to identify household segments (groups of households with similar behaviors and attitudes about climate change) based on the methodology developed by Maibach et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref010">10</a>], as well as highlight differences in Australia between different religious groups. We examined responses across four religious groupings (Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion, Buddhist, Christian non-literalists and Christian literalists). We found substantive effects on climate change beliefs based on religious affiliation. For the non-religious grouping (Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion) the differences in beliefs can be explained by either socio-demographics, environmental attitudes or environmental knowledge. However for the other groupings (Buddhist, Christian literalists and Christian non-literalists) the effects cannot be explained by these variables alone.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Empirical work has shown that there are distinctly different Christian environmental attitudes [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref003">3</a>]. Within Christian circles there are contrasting themes of “anthropomorphic dominance” and “stewardship of nature”. Hand and van Liere [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref006">6</a>] showed that in the US, members of denominations such as Baptists and Mormons were more likely to adhere to the first, while Episcopalians and Methodists the second. Moreover, it is these world views that seem to determine whether an individual would support environmental policy. In an extension of this research, an examination of Christian liberalism in the US revealed that support for spending on the environment correlates with an image of God that is gracious (i.e. benevolent and not judgmental) and with being Catholic [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref013">13</a>]; and that a rigid political and religious view is related to a lack of environmental concern [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref014">14</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref015">15</a>]. However, there was no significant difference between Judeo-Christians in general and other religions in regard to environmental concerns. The Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale provides a comprehensive bibliography of the literature on the environmental stance of the major religions [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref016">16</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Focusing more closely on American evangelical Christians, Smith and Leiserowitz [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref003">3</a>] showed that within this group there is a diversity of views on climate change and that this diversity is associated with “affect based value orientations, ideologies and worldviews” (p.8) rather than religion. Nevertheless, even though a majority believes in climate change, compared with non-evangelicals, American evangelicals are less likely to believe that (a) climate change is occurring, (b) human activity is the cause, and (c) scientists think that climate change is occurring.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Greeley [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref014">14</a>] and Kanagy and Nelson [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref017">17</a>] highlighted the problem of focusing only on religious variables to explain variations in concern for the environment. Their studies showed that when cultural, social and demographic influences were taken into account, significant relationships between Christian perspective and dominion over nature were no longer apparent. These authors identified, therefore, a complex relationship between religious affiliation, socio-demographics and environmental concern. Taking into account this complexity leads to the conclusion that “religious individuals—even those identified as conservative—are no less likely than non-religious individuals to identify themselves as environmentalists” [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref017">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence, this line of research effectively concluded that the association between a Christian perspective and dominion over nature was spurious [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref014">14</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref017">17</a>]. The apparent relationship may rather be a reflection of political conservatism, or some other socio-demographic variable [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref018">18</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref019">19</a>]. However, a thorn remained in the side of this position. One consistent result from US studies is in accord with White’s thesis, and shows that those adhering more closely to a literal biblical viewpoint are less likely to support pro-environmental action [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref003">3</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref007">7</a>]. In addition, Guth et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref007">7</a>] showed that US “secularists” generally support environmental policy, while Catholics are in the middle ground between the above extremes. Taken together, these results support the contention that a more appropriate conclusion is that religious factors are indirectly causal rather than spurious. Furthermore, a key variable emerging from the literature on Christian belief was literal interpretation of the bible. The large number of Christians attached to evangelical churches in the US, likely to hold more literal views, is an important issue in overall public opinion. Australia has a smaller proportion of Christians who identify as evangelicals. Nevertheless, given the differences observed in the US, it did seem worthwhile to include a focus in our work on the distinction in climate change attitudes and behavior between literal and non-literal Christians in Australia.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More recently Truelove and Joireman [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref020">20</a>], developed two scales: a Christian orthodoxy scale, and a biblical literal scale. Their thesis was that there could be either a “social-altruistic” effect that would have Christians supportive of environmental policy, or a “lower-knowledge-of-the-biosphere” effect that would produce the reverse effect. Then, from survey results, they discovered that Christian orthodoxy and biblical literalism were inversely associated with all measures of environmental behavior, and that the lower-knowledge-of-the-biosphere effect was dominant. Similarly, the impact of respondents’ scientific knowledge has also been shown to be critical in other studies in Germany [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref021">21</a>], Sweden [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref022">22</a>] and Britain [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref023">23</a>]. Thus a need to take into account further mediating variables, altruism and knowledge, when assessing the relationship between religion and attitudes towards the environment has been suggested by these studies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sherkat and Ellison [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref024">24</a>] attempted to reconcile the previous empirical work on the relationship between Christian beliefs, political beliefs, socio-demographics and environmental attitudes. They used structural equation modelling based on survey data from the United States to estimate the effect of various beliefs and socio-demographic variables on environmental orientation. Political and private environmental activism was found to be significantly negatively associated with political conservatism, biblical inerrancy (political activism only), conservative Protestantism, rurality and southern (US) location, and positively associated with belief in problem seriousness, stewardship, and education level. Sherkat and Ellison [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref024">24</a>] concluded that: “Future studies investigating the connections between religious factors and a host of other political concerns would benefit from adapting a more comprehensive view of religious influences, and attending to nuances of political beliefs and connections.”
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For Buddhism the relationship between environmental concern and religious affiliation is a complex one. White [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref005">5</a>] had contrasted the dominion over nature view which he felt lay at the base of Judeo-Christian faiths with the “very nearly the mirror image” view on the human-nature relationship of Buddhism [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref005">5</a>]. Harris [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref025">25</a>] challenged this characterization by White and argued instead that the Buddhist goal of detachment includes detachment from the natural environment. The injunction in classical Buddhist texts for monks not to dig in the ground due to the possibility of injuring a worm is driven more, Harris argued, by concern to avoid spiritual pollution for the monk than it is by any inherent value for the natural environment [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref025">25</a>]. Other writers [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref026">26</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref027">27</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref028">28</a>] have argued that the White interpretation of Buddhist environmental principles is a modern Western creation that bears little resemblance to traditional Buddhist views.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some support for Harris’s statement was found by Hayes and Marangudakis [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref023">23</a>] in their research on environmental attitudes in Britain. They found no difference in dominion over nature attitudes for followers of Abrahamic religions (Jews, Christians and Muslims) as opposed to their category of non-Abrahamic which included Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs and other faiths with a stated belief in a higher power. Unfortunately their failure to explore possible differences within religions within the non-Abrahamic category makes this a rather limited result. We are aware of no other research that has empirically examined the relationship between Buddhist beliefs and environmental or climate change attitudes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the research activity proceeding elsewhere, there has been little consideration in Australia of the relationships between climate change and religion [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref029">29</a>]. Recent studies have tended to focus on the influence of belief about future temperature increases or the efficacy of policy [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref001">1</a>], and the sources of scepticism about climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref030">30</a>]. Tranter’s [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref002">2</a>] research comes closest to examining climate change and religion, but includes results only for those with no religion and those engaging in spiritual religious practices. It is important that more research on religion is conducted in Australia, because as Tjernstron and Tietenberg [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref008">8</a>] show there is considerable difficulty in simply transferring results from one national jurisdiction to another. By comparing survey results from 26 countries, they showed that individual attitudes towards climate change affect the type of climate change policy that different countries introduce. Further, individual attitudes are shaped by how individuals react to the specific consequence of climate change, information, the openness of their society, and by attitudes toward the trustworthiness of government.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus the evidence from the literature is that religious affiliation can affect environmental attitudes. However in some cases differences in environmental attitudes across religious groupings may reflect socio-demographic variables, political conservatism or scientific knowledge. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that there are several distinct environmental worldviews that exist within Christian thought and that some are quite supportive of climate action. Thus, it should be recognized that within religious groupings as well as across religious groupings there is likely to be heterogeneity in perspectives.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This literature directed our research to examine the following five issues: After accounting for other socio-demographic influences and environmental knowledge, are there different attitudes and behavior in relation to climate change depending on religious affiliation? Are members of certain religious affiliations less likely than other members of the community to support climate change action? Does lower knowledge of climate change issues result in lower support for climate change action? Are there broad systems of belief that form the basis of climate change attitudes and behavior? Can differences in climate change attitudes and behavior be explained by the White hypothesis about beliefs in man’s dominion over nature? These issues provided the motivation for the analysis described in the remainder of this paper.</p>
