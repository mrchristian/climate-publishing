 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results on the association between religious affiliation and segment membership are presented in 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0134868.t002">Table 2</a>. The results suggest that the Christian non-literal denominations are likely to most closely represent the overall sample, though they do have a slightly smaller proportion in the 
  <span class="italic">Alarmed</span> segment. The Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion group (43.8%) and Buddhists (45.7%) have a much higher percentage of people located in the 
  <span class="italic">Alarmed</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Concerned</span> segments than the sample overall (33.3%). Further, Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion (16.3%) and Buddhists (2.9%) have a lower percentage of people located in the 
  <span class="italic">Doubtful</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Dismissive</span> segments than the sample overall (20.6%). The respondents who indicate affiliation with Christian denominations that have a literal interpretation of scripture have a smaller proportion of people located in the 
  <span class="italic">Alarmed</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Concerned</span> segments (19.6%). The Christian literalists are also more likely to have a much higher percentage of people located in the

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further explore the relationship between religious affiliation and climate change beliefs, results are presented in 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0134868.t003">Table 3</a> showing climate change beliefs for the four religious groups identified in this research. The results mostly mirror what was reported in 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0134868.t002">Table 2</a>. Those who identify with a Christian non-literal denomination have very similar attitudes to the sample overall. Those who are Buddhist or Atheist/Agnostic/No religion are more likely to believe: that global warming is occurring, in human causation, that there is a scientific consensus about global warming and the issue is important. They are also more likely to think that their own actions will make a difference, and that Australia should do something to reduce global warming, and to have a higher level of knowledge about climate change (as indicated by the test score). Again, those who identify with a Christian denomination with a literal view of scripture are less likely to believe: that global warming is occurring, in human causation, that there is a scientific consensus and that their own mitigation actions would be effective. They are also less likely to consider the issue to be important and that Australia should act to reduce emissions. ANOVA and Chi-square tests were also run to determine whether there were significant differences between the religious groups on these eight variables; there were in all cases (see final column of 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0134868.t003">Table 3</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The findings from this table and the previous one confirm that climate change beliefs are different across different religious groups. This raises the question of whether these differences are due to the religious beliefs of respondents, or whether they are due to attitudes, knowledge or socio-demographics, a question which we seek to answer next.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before presenting the results of the regression analyses, we first present the results from a factor analysis conducted on the items in the NEP scale. As shown in the Rotated Component Matrix (see 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.t004" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0134868.t004">Table 4</a>), we identified four factors which we labelled 
  <span class="italic">Eco Crisis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Human Ingenuity</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Human Rule</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Earth Limits</span> based on the variables that loaded highly on each factor. The four factor solution had moderate total variance explained (58.6%), though a high KMO statistic (0.889). The reliability of two of the items was satisfactory, but the alphas for 
  <span class="italic">Human Rule</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Earth Limits</span> were slightly but not substantially below the standard acceptable level of 0.60.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next we examined how the mean values for the four factor scores representing the four NEP sub-scales differ across the four religious groupings (see 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.t005" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0134868.t005">Table 5</a>). One-way ANOVA’s indicate that there are significant differences only for three of the four variables: 
  <span class="italic">Human Ingenuity</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Human Rule</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Earth Limits</span>. Christian literalists and non-literalists have a higher belief in the ability of human ingenuity to solve environmental problems than either Buddhists or Atheists/Agnostics or those with no religion. Interestingly, the highest levels of belief in human rule over nature are among Christian literalists and Buddhists, with Christian non-literalists having a fairly neutral value and Atheists/Agnostics/No Religion having a negative value. For belief in earth limits, the highest positive value was among those who are Atheists/Agnostics and those with no religion, Christian non-literalists again have a fairly neutral value, while Christian literalists and Buddhists again share a moderate to large negative value. At least in terms of belief in human rule and earth limits, Buddhist attitudes are similar to Christian ones, and both are quite different from Atheists/Agnostics/No Religion, as has been found by Hayes and Marangudakis [

  <span class="italic">Alarmed</span> segment was scaled as “1” for the dependent variable and the 
  <span class="italic">Dismissive</span> segment was scaled as “6”. The Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion category was omitted and the various effects were measured relative to this group. The first model only included religious affiliation as an independent variable. In this regression, similar to the results presented in 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0134868.t002">Table 2</a>, the Buddhist category was negatively signed but with an insignificant coefficient. The Christian non-literalist and Christian literalist had positively signed coefficients, indicating that members of both of these groups were less likely to be in one of the 
  <span class="italic">Alarmed</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Concerned</span> segments, and more likely to be in the 
  <span class="italic">Doubtful</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Dismissive</span> segments. Furthermore, the magnitude of the coefficient for the Christian literalists was almost one, implying that Christian literalists were on average likely to be located one segment lower than Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion respondents.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall this first regression had quite low explanatory power, with a McFadden R
  <span class="sup">2</span> of 0.012. However, this score is different from an R
  <span class="sup">2</span> in standard regression and is a relative measure that is comparable only to other models estimated on the same data set. Comparing the R
  <span class="sup">2</span> of this model with the other two models, it is apparent that the explanatory power of models 2 and 3 is an order of magnitude better. This implies that religious affiliation had some explanatory power in terms of climate change beliefs, but that variables related to socio-demographics and attitudes collectively had much more explanatory power.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Model 2 socio-demographic, attitudinal variables and knowledge (as represented by the test score) were included as explanatory variables in addition to religious affiliation. Being female, being more educated, not working or being self-employed or being retired, and knowledge of climate change were associated with a greater likelihood of being in a segment with greater concern about climate change. In terms of attitudes, concern about an ecological crisis or that the earth is reaching its limits was also associated with a greater likelihood of being in a segment with greater concern about climate change. However, human rule over nature and human ingenuity were associated with a reduced likelihood of being in a segment with greater concern about climate change. In this model the coefficient for Buddhism was significant, implying that once knowledge, socio-demographics and environmental attitude were taken into account, there was a difference between the Buddhist and the Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion categories in terms of their climate change attitudes and behaviors. The magnitude of the Christian non-literal and literal coefficients were substantially lower than in the previous model, but still showed moderate and significant effects. The signs of these various significant religion variables showed that the Buddhists were more concerned than the Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion group, and the two Christian groups less concerned. The magnitude of the coefficients for religious affiliation can be compared to other dummy variables to show relative effects. Thus the effect of being Buddhist or Christian literalist is similar in magnitude to the effect of gender and being self-employed, and larger than the effect of being employed full or part-time.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Model 3 we present one additional regression where we included interactions between the religion variables and the variable representing human rule over nature. This interaction has been included given White’s [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref005">5</a>] contention that there is a link between a Judeo-Christian perspective and a desire for dominion over nature. While no significant relationship was observed in the interaction term for either Buddhists or Christian literalists, intriguingly there was a negative and significant relationship between human rule and Christian non-literal, with the missing category being Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion. This relationship suggests that while human rule over nature does affect segment membership, the effect of a unit change in human rule over nature is smaller for Christian non-literalists than for those who are Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion. In addition, as shown in 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.t005" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0134868.t005">Table 5</a>, Christian non-literalists had on average neutral views about human rule over nature, with Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion on average disagreeing with human rule over nature and Christian literalists and Buddhists agreeing on average. Taken together, these findings suggest that belief in human rule over nature affected segment membership; however the effect differed across religious groupings. The combined effect (beta weight times the mean value of the variable) was greatest for Christian literalists and Buddhists, followed by Christian non-literalists and then those who identified as Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion. These findings imply that White’s [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref005">5</a>] contention that there is a link between a Judeo-Christian perspective and a desire for dominion over nature, and its consequences is more subtle than previously thought. It suggests that it is (1) not limited to a Judeo-Christian perspective, and (2) it differs in effect between Christian literalists and non-literalists.
