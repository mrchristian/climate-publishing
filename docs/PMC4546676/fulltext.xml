Fully understanding their separate and combined effects requires a mechanistic understanding at the local scale where their effects are ultimately realized. Here we applied an individual-based model of fish population dynamics to evaluate the role of local stream variability in modifying responses of Coastal Cutthroat Trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii</italic>) to scenarios simulating identical changes in temperature and stream flows linked to forest harvest, climate change, and their combined effects over six decades. We parameterized the model for four neighboring streams located in a forested headwater catchment in northwestern Oregon, USA with multi-year, daily measurements of stream temperature, flow, and turbidity (2007&#x02013;2011), and field measurements of both instream habitat structure and three years of annual trout population estimates. Model simulations revealed that variability in habitat conditions among streams (depth, available habitat) mediated the effects of forest harvest and climate change. Net effects for most simulated trout responses were different from or less than the sum of their separate scenarios. In some cases, forest harvest countered the effects of climate change through increased summer flow. Climate change most strongly influenced trout (earlier fry emergence, reductions in biomass of older trout, increased biomass of young-of-year), but these changes did not consistently translate into reductions in biomass over time. Forest harvest, in contrast, produced fewer and less consistent responses in trout. Earlier fry emergence driven by climate change was the most consistent simulated response, whereas survival, growth, and biomass were inconsistent. Overall our findings indicate a host of local processes can strongly influence how populations respond to broad scale effects of land use and climate change.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>BEP was funded by an EPA Science to Achieve Results STAR Grant and J Frances Allen Scholarship through American Fisheries Society.

Within the range of a species, it is reasonable to expect increased variation in local environmental conditions initially, with more homogeneous and coherent changes manifested as the effects of land use and climate change intensify [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Accordingly, local variability in environmental conditions may play a key role for understanding emerging responses to land use and climate change, but it has yet to be fully explored [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

We simulated Gus Creek, Upper Mainstem Trask, Pothole Creek, and Rock Creek. Precipitation in the Trask Watershed study area occurs primarily during winter and varies by elevation, with rain at lower elevations and a mix of snow and rain at higher elevations. These climatic conditions, combined with steep terrain and shallow soils, lead to flashy winter flows linked to winter storms, followed by declining flows in spring and an extended low flow period in late summer [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our study period captured three years that were marginally higher in mean annual precipitation (2758 mm &#x000b7; y<sup>-1</sup>, 2834 mm &#x000b7; y<sup>-1</sup>, 2783 mm &#x000b7; y<sup>-1</sup>), one year that was lower (2255mm &#x000b7; y<sup>-1</sup>), and one representative year (2626 mm &#x000b7; y<sup>-1</sup>) when compared to the long-term annual mean (2500 mm &#x000b7;y<sup>-1</sup>) for the Trask River watershed [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Daily mean stream temperatures were moderate year-round ranging from 6&#x02013;12&#x000b0;C. The fish communities of these streams were dominated by resident Coastal Cutthroat Trout <italic>Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii</italic>, with sculpins <italic>Cottus</italic> spp., juvenile Steelhead <italic>O</italic>. <italic>mykiss</italic>, and juvenile Coho Salmon <italic>O</italic>. <italic>kisutch</italic> at some sites. Movement of fish among study streams consists of a very small rate of exchange (&#x0003c;1%, J. Dunham, unpublished data), which is likely not important demographically [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In these coastal streams, resident Coastal Cutthroat Trout spawn in the spring generally in April and May with fry commonly emerging from April to August [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although trout grow all year, most growth for age 1+ trout occurs in winter and spring [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Streams varied in their local features (<xref rid="pone.0135334.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>; [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Average summer flows were similar among all streams, but flows in Rock Creek were more variable in summer. Although Rock Creek was the largest stream in watershed area, it had similar availability of habitat in summer relative to Gus Creek, which is half its watershed area. Gus Creek has the most variable flow in winter, and at times it exceeded flows in Rock Creek. Upper Mainstem was the coldest stream year-round, and it was the smallest in both watershed area and wetted summer area. Pothole Creek had the highest and most variable turbidity in winter and the lowest in summer.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>The trout model</title><p>The individual-based trout model we used was version 5.0 of inSTREAM, downloaded August 30, 2014 (<xref rid="pone.0135334.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). This model has been fully described, and is publically available ([<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.humboldt.edu/ecomodel">http://www.humboldt.edu/ecomodel</ext-link>). Unless noted here, default parameter values for Cutthroat Trout and small streams were extracted from the literature [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and details of model calibration are in [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. InSTREAM has shown realistic trout responses for individuals [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and populations [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Details of model calibration can be found in Penaluna et al. [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although we calibrated inSTREAM to each stream using three years of trout population estimates from each field site, values of model calibrations were the same at three of the four streams, except for Upper Mainstem (<xref rid="pone.0135334.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Of the parameters considered in a sensitivity analysis (baseflow, benthic and drift food, summer temperature, hiding cover, piscivory risk, redd scour, spawning gravel, velocity shelter, winter temperature), biomass of adult trout was consistently sensitive to baseflow, with higher baseflows resulting in greater biomass of adult trout for these streams [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although there are multiple stochastic elements in inSTREAM, it is not a highly stochastic model. Mortality is the main process represented stochastically. Other stochasticity occurs in initialization of model run (various aspects), assignment of length when trout emerge from eggs, whether a female that is ready to spawn does on an actual day, and mortality of eggs [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Hence, differences in replicate model runs represent natural variability and uncertainty in stochastic processes.</p><p>InSTREAM captures many complexities of real streams. Within the inSTREAM environment, each study stream was represented as a reach (here, 210&#x02013;250 m in length) made up of rectangular cells (here, 31&#x02013;35 cells per reach). Reach-scale variables included flow, stream temperature, and turbidity, which varied daily. Each cell represented a unit of microhabitat from one to several square meters in area that had a specific depth, velocity, area of velocity shelter for drift-feeding, area of spawning gravel, and distance to hiding refuge. Stream depth and velocity varied daily with flow. Trout were represented as freely feeding individuals following emergence from gravel. Each trout was attributed with a length, weight, condition, and sex, and was assigned to a cell within which it feeds. Because trout were modeled as individuals, population dynamics emerged from the behaviors and fates of individual fish. The complete trout life cycle was represented in the model (redds, egg, fry, juvenile, adult). Redds were represented by both the number of eggs they contain and egg developmental status.</p><p>InSTREAM operated at a daily time step following a set schedule of actions (in order: spawning, habitat selection, growth, survival, and egg development). At the start of each day, daily flow, temperature, and turbidity were taken from input files for each scenario, which are based on actual field observations. Depth and velocity for each habitat cell were updated based on the flow input. Hence, these daily updates allowed for changing environmental conditions corresponding to each scenario (see scenarios and model input sections for more details).</p><p>Female trout spawn once per year if conditions, including date, flow and temperature thresholds, and female size, were met. When conditions for spawning were met, female trout moved to a cell with spawning gravel and created a redd. The number of eggs deposited increased geometrically as a function of spawner fork length. Each breeding adult (female and male) incurs a weight loss of 20% to represent energy loss due to reproduction. The model follows egg survival, development, and emergence. The developmental stage of eggs within a redd was a function of temperature degree days. Each day, the model updates developmental stage, determining how many eggs die due to processes such as temperature stress and disease, scouring, or desiccation. The timing of spawning was important because flow and temperature fluctuations, both high and low, influenced egg mortality. When surviving eggs within a redd were fully developed, they were converted into new trout, analogous to emergence and first feeding in nature.</p><p>All trout selected a cell and feeding activity to maximize short-term (90 day) fitness, which was a function of the growth and survival probability offered by each potential cell [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Habitat selection was executed in order of fish size, with the largest fish selecting cells first, representing a length-based hierarchy. The version of inSTREAM we used assumes that trout fed during daylight hours and competed for the food available in each cell [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Both metabolic and activity costs are subtracted from growth (net energy intake) and growth emerges as a function of trout size and habitat conditions (depth, and velocity). However, trout can also lose energy during spawning season (if they mature and if they spawn). Food intake was limited by food availability and the trout&#x02019;s ability to capture food. Food availability depends on how much food was in each cell and how much was consumed by competing trout. The ability to capture food depends on trout size (with increasing length because larger trout see and swim better) and habitat conditions. There are two modes of feeding for trout, drift-feeding or search feeding. Food intake was represented with a drift-feeding approach where trout capture invertebrates as they are carried within range by the current. Search feeding is active searching for food. It is the primary feeding behavior for young-of-year and consists of 10&#x02013;20% of food supply for adults [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The survival probability offered by a cell was determined by functions representing mortality due to predation by terrestrial animals, trout predation, disease and starvation, and high temperature. These functions depended on individual length and weight and on habitat variables. Hence, trout grew and survived according to growth rate and survival probabilities of the selected cell.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Scenarios</title><p>We designed this study to mimic changes in stream temperature and flows associated with separate and combined effects of forest harvest and climate change. In addition to these changes, we modeled a baseline scenario that mimicked the natural variability in temperature and flow observed from 2007&#x02013;2011 at each stream. We generated 63 years of results for each scenario (duration explained in detail in section on model input). To account for two forest harvests on a 40-year rotation, we applied changes to stream flow and temperature due to forest harvest in years 1 and 41 for all of our analyses. To understand the influence of each environmental regime, we also compared the separate and combined effects of stream temperature and flow for each scenario.</p><p>To model the effects of forest harvest, we comprehensively assessed information from recent forest harvest studies in the region. We used a conservative scenario of changes in magnitude and timing of stream temperature and flow. Accordingly, our forest harvest scenario represented a composite of current practices that include riparian buffers and a 40-year rotation. More generally, the literature suggested increased summer temperatures, increased summer flows, and increased flow from winter storm events for 1&#x02013;2 decades following each harvest. Hence, for each cutting, we elevated stream temperatures for 15 years, with the first five years having daily mean stream temperature increased by 0.37&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] uniformly, followed by a gradual, linear decrease in daily mean stream temperature by 0.037&#x000b0;C each year for 10 years until recovery of baseline conditions [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, baseline temperature values were restored in year 16 and again in year 57 because that is when the forest canopy would be expected to be restored, providing shade to the stream. Responses of flow regimes to forest harvest are variable, but in the Coast Range of Oregon, alterations to flow regimes can last for 20 years with changes to storm events and seasonal low flows [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We increased daily water yield by 20% on the days when a storm event occurred that generated flow &#x0003e; 2 standard deviations above the annual mean, because although water yield increases from forest harvest are highly variable, they generally increase by approximately 20% [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We increased summer (July-September) daily mean flows by 45% above baseline for five years [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], then decreased summer mean flows by 2.25% per year for 15 years until baseline was reached in year 20 post-harvest and again in year 60, because as the forest regrows, more water is used by trees.</p><p>We generated the climate change scenario by increasing year-round stream temperatures and decreasing fall and winter flows. We increased stream temperatures by 0.06&#x000b0;C per year, a rate based on stream temperature trends occurring in the Pacific Northwest over the past 50 years [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], reaching 3.78&#x000b0;C higher than baseline at the end of the study period. This final increase in stream temperature is within the range of predicted warming for the Pacific Northwest [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We decreased mean fall flows by 0.25% (October-December) and mean winter flows by 0.49% (January-March) each year [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], resulting in a gradual decrease over time that reached 15.75% below baseline for fall flows and 30.87% below baseline for winter flows at the end of the simulation. Streams of coastal Oregon generally have hydrographs dominated by rainfall, not snowmelt and, hence, key changes related to climate change are occurring during peak winter months due to decreasing rain and not during spring and summer snowmelt [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>For the combined scenario, we first made the changes from forest harvest and then added alterations from climate change.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Model Input</title><p>We parameterized the model for each stream with field measurements of habitat features recorded during seasonal low flow (August-September) in 2009. Measurements of habitat were completed and used to delineate cells. For each cell, we measured availability of velocity shelter and spawning gravel as well as distance to hiding cover. Depth, velocity, and water surface elevation of each cell were measured over a range of low, medium, and high flows from 2009&#x02013;2010. We computed daily mean (arithmetic) of flow, stream temperature, and turbidity from field measurements recorded every 10 minutes from March 2007 to September 2011 in each of the four streams. Mean turbidity was measured using an instream nephelometer, which measures the scatter of a focused light beam by suspended solids. We evaluated multiple years of simulated data under each scenario (i.e., baseline, forest harvest, climate change, combined) for each stream. Because we had observations from only 2007&#x02013;2011, we randomly selected the environmental regimes from one of those initial years every year for 67 years (a duration chosen for computational reasons). This ordering of years became the baseline scenario and was modified to create all alternative scenarios. Once the ordering of years was set for a scenario, then daily values of each environmental regime were read into the model. After we ran our scenarios, we ignored the first four years of data from all scenarios to eliminate initialization effects [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Accordingly, we applied the changes in stream temperature and flow from scenarios beginning in year five, which became year one after initialization effects were eliminated. Therefore, we used a total of 63 years of results to analyze each scenario.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Responses of trout</title><p>We analyzed output produced every 30 simulated days from five replicate model runs for each scenario.

Seasons include summer (July, August) and winter (January, February). Age classes during winter were restricted to ages 1 and older because the model assigns an additional year to each trout on January 1<sup>st</sup> every year (in keeping with convention in fisheries biology), thus there are no age-0 trout in winter. For biomass, growth, and survival, we used average responses of each trout age class (ages 0, 1, 2, 3+). Timing of fry emergence was evaluated as the median emergence date (Julian day at which half the age 0 fish had emerged), estimated using MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox Release 2012 (The MathWorks, Inc.

In cases of statistically significant differences (alpha &#x02264; 0.05) indicated by these analyses, we evaluated pairwise comparisons among the four scenarios using a non-parametric Tukey&#x02019;s test on ranks. We focused these tests on deviations of responses from a stream&#x02019;s specific baseline scenario to responses observed for that stream related to forest harvest, climate change, and combined scenarios (i.e., baseline vs. other scenarios).

In addition, within the simulated scenarios of forest harvest and climate change, we tested the individual influences of stream temperature and flow on differences in biomass of trout in summer relative to baseline values. We tested the null hypothesis that the median of the difference between baseline and the other scenarios was symmetric about 0.

Among our four study streams, trout in Gus Creek often showed unique responses indicating an overall resistance to change due to differences in physical habitat conditions compared to the other streams. Gus Creek, for its watershed area, supports a relatively larger wetted area and deeper pools in summer, a time period when stresses on fish are high [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and both growth [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and survival are minimal [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

Although our results contrast with other research of fish responses to climate change, which typically reports relatively uniform responses by stream-fish across landscapes [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and for a wide-range of other biota as well [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], more recently, increasing attention has been drawn to the role of local variability in physical habitat as an important player in mediating the effects of climate change [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Separate projections differ from scenarios incorporating combined effects</title><p>Simulated responses of trout from projections of forest harvest and climate change scenarios differed substantially from scenarios incorporating their combined effects (<xref rid="pone.0135334.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0135334.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Although we observed cases where the combined effects of forest harvest and climate change exceeded the additive influences of each, we commonly noted interactions where the effects from the combined scenario were less than the additive effects from separate scenarios. For example, over the entire study period in Pothole Creek, forest harvest increased biomass and the combined scenario decreased biomass, but less so than the climate change scenario alone. In general in ecological settings, although it may be expected that multiple stressors should interact synergistically, antagonistic responses are more frequently observed [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In some cases we simulated here, forest harvest countered the effects of climate change. Specifically, the relative biomass of trout in Gus Creek increased under the combined scenario compared to climate change alone because increases in low-flow discharge associated with forest harvest offsets climate-driven declines in flows. Such findings are, however, highly context dependent and they depend on how future climate effects are realized. For example, trout responses to climate change could be more dramatic than we have modeled here if we had modeled longer simulations or when natural environmental conditions approach or exceed stressful thresholds for trout, especially during seasonal low flow. For example, if stream temperature continues to warm towards levels that are stressful to trout, increasing summer flows from forest harvest may no longer effectively offset warming temperatures.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0135334.t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0135334.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Pairwise Comparisons for Differences in Total Summer Biomass between Scenario and Baseline.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0135334.t002g" xlink:href="pone.0135334.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="4" align="center" rowspan="1">1<sup>st</sup> harvest</th><th colspan="4" align="center" rowspan="1">2<sup>nd</sup> harvest</th><th colspan="4" align="center" rowspan="1">entire 63 years</th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">stream</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">scenario</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394; (g)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">95% CI</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">V</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p-value</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394; (g)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">95% CI</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">V</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p-value</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394; (g)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">95% CI</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">V</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gus</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FH</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">576</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">172, 928</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">178</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.26</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1000</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">560, 1438</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">200</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Reductions in biomass of older trout come from both smaller-sized and reduced number of older individuals. Although other studies have similarly predicted a decrease in body size of individuals with increasing temperature from climate change, underlying mechanisms have been difficult to identify [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Because it is not clear how climate change will influence the amount of drift or benthic food for trout, in our simulations, we assume that food availability does not change with temperature [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Increased temperature due to climate change leads to higher metabolism in trout, but because food intake does not change trout do not grow.

It is not surprising that trout responses were minimal across streams in response to projections of forest harvest because this stressor acts as a pulsed event (where temperature and flow returned to baseline conditions within 1&#x02013;2 decades). It is worth noting, however, that we only considered effects of forest harvest on stream temperature and flow, and that other influences could also have important implications. For example, changes in stream habitat associated with loss (or addition) of large wood as a result of forestry practices and stream restoration [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and changes to trout food supply following harvest [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, consideration of these additional factors might be expected to further reinforce the importance of the specific array of local conditions mediating trout responses to multiple stressors. Additionally, we found the types of effects realized from forest harvest were important in two streams (Rock Creek and Upper Mainstem; <xref rid="pone.0135334.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) with the net effect switching from increasing biomass after the first harvest to decreasing biomass after the second harvest. The net effect switches in these streams, not because of forest harvest <italic>per se</italic>, but rather because trout in these streams were less able to cope with instream changes from either stressor (second perturbation of forest harvest or climate change) after about 30 years.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Most visible response of trout to change was a phenology metric</title><p>The most visible and consistent response from our simulations was earlier fry emergence driven by climate change (<xref rid="pone.0135334.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0135334.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>), whereas demographic responses of survival, growth, or biomass were not detectable and inconsistent across scenarios and streams (<xref rid="pone.0135334.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0135334.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Under the climate change and combined scenarios, there were consistent trends toward earlier fry emergence for all streams over time. Over the entire study period, median timing of fry emergence was earlier by 4 to 7 days/decade for climate change, but it was earlier by only 4 to 5 days days/decade for the combined scenario due to the trend towards later emergence generally observed with forest harvest. Early fry emergence under the climate change scenario largely results from warmer stream temperature that accelerates the development of eggs across streams over time. Similarly, a lab study shows that fry emergence can be delayed due to increased temporal variance in temperature regimes [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Collectively, we highlight the importance of magnitude and variability of temperature regimes on emergence. Studies of salmonid fishes in other systems have shown that earlier emergence timing can negatively influence survival of subsequent life stages [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In general, changes in phenology are a reliable indicator of climate change on diverse taxa [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].

Overall, survival and growth of age-0 and age-1 trout frequently responded to changes linked to forest harvest and climate change more than older age classes. Age-0 trout exhibited increased survival over summer for all scenarios because earlier fry emergence (<xref rid="pone.0135334.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0135334.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) increased recruitment, with the exception of Upper Mainstem which is similar to an observational study [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].

Age-0 trout showed increased biomass for climate change and combined scenarios compared to baseline (except Gus Creek under the combined scenario). During both seasons, age-1 trout showed mixed responses in growth and biomass for climate change and combined scenarios compared to baseline across streams. In contrast, biomass responded more uniformly across all age classes. Age-2 and age-3+ trout most consistently showed reductions in biomass for climate change and combined scenarios compared to baseline across streams. These idiosyncratic responses for demography may have been driven by the complex interplay of underlying factors, including density-dependence, specific requirements of environmental conditions at each age class (habitat), and variability in demography and the environment [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In our simulations, we held most variables constant and equal across streams, except for local differences in physical habitat conditions and variability in environmental regimes among streams highlighting habitat (depth and area of available habitat) as the key driver [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The lack of coherence among responses of demography of trout has practical consequences because biological responses commonly quantified in field studies (survival, growth, and biomass) may not be able to consistently indicate the effects of land use and climate change [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, results of this work reveal a diverse array of responses to identical changes in stream temperature and flow projected from forest harvest and climate change on four neighboring streams within the same headwater catchment. We infer that it is important to identify the array of key features at the local scale that will allow fish to resist environmental change. If we had simulated higher changes in magnitude over longer time periods, we might have expected to see greater coherence in responses. For example, recent work has shown that as the effects of climate change intensify, uncertainty regarding species&#x02019; responses to climate become less important, relative to our uncertainty about climate itself [<xref rid="pone.0135334.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. As the growing importance of both land use and climate change becomes more broadly accepted and acted upon within the policy arena, there is an increasing need for approaches to clearly attribute biological responses to such changes. Although there are conditions where it is relatively straightforward to diagnose the influences of land use, climate change, or other stressors on biological responses, there are many other contexts where attribution will be substantially more complex and less certain. As this and other recent studies have shown, models based heavily in field data that are capable of addressing such complexity can allow a multitude of useful insights into interactions among local processes. Our findings provide support for continuing this line of inquiry and reveal the importance of disentangling the role of local variability in physical habitat conditions in streams under different land uses and a changing climate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135334.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Map of Trask Watershed, OR, USA, with Photos of Field Sites.</title><p>Sub-basin of Pothole Creek is purple, Gus Creek is light blue, Upper Mainstem Trask is yellow, and Rock Creek is brown.
