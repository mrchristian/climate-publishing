  <div class="title">Differences in Total Summer Biomass of Trout between Scenarios and Baseline.</div>
  <p>Difference in mean total summer biomass (g) from the five replicated simulations over time for each scenario of forest harvest (FH), climate change (CC), and their combined effects (FH+CC) compared to baseline, in Gus Creek, Pothole Creek, Rock Creek, and Upper Mainstem (UM). Scenarios include manipulations of stream temperature and flow regimes (see 
   <a rid="sec002" ref-type="sec" href="#sec002">methods</a> narrative for detail). Only significant trends (P &lt; 0.05) for the entire study period have been numerically shown with the slope of the trend (g/decade).
