 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We designed this study to mimic changes in stream temperature and flows associated with separate and combined effects of forest harvest and climate change. In addition to these changes, we modeled a baseline scenario that mimicked the natural variability in temperature and flow observed from 2007–2011 at each stream. We generated 63 years of results for each scenario (duration explained in detail in section on model input). To account for two forest harvests on a 40-year rotation, we applied changes to stream flow and temperature due to forest harvest in years 1 and 41 for all of our analyses. To understand the influence of each environmental regime, we also compared the separate and combined effects of stream temperature and flow for each scenario.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To model the effects of forest harvest, we comprehensively assessed information from recent forest harvest studies in the region. We used a conservative scenario of changes in magnitude and timing of stream temperature and flow. Accordingly, our forest harvest scenario represented a composite of current practices that include riparian buffers and a 40-year rotation. More generally, the literature suggested increased summer temperatures, increased summer flows, and increased flow from winter storm events for 1–2 decades following each harvest. Hence, for each cutting, we elevated stream temperatures for 15 years, with the first five years having daily mean stream temperature increased by 0.37°C [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref022">22</a>] uniformly, followed by a gradual, linear decrease in daily mean stream temperature by 0.037°C each year for 10 years until recovery of baseline conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref025">25</a>]. Therefore, baseline temperature values were restored in year 16 and again in year 57 because that is when the forest canopy would be expected to be restored, providing shade to the stream. Responses of flow regimes to forest harvest are variable, but in the Coast Range of Oregon, alterations to flow regimes can last for 20 years with changes to storm events and seasonal low flows [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref023">23</a>]. We increased daily water yield by 20% on the days when a storm event occurred that generated flow &gt; 2 standard deviations above the annual mean, because although water yield increases from forest harvest are highly variable, they generally increase by approximately 20% [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref023">23</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref024">24</a>]. We increased summer (July-September) daily mean flows by 45% above baseline for five years [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref023">23</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref038">38</a>], then decreased summer mean flows by 2.25% per year for 15 years until baseline was reached in year 20 post-harvest and again in year 60, because as the forest regrows, more water is used by trees.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We generated the climate change scenario by increasing year-round stream temperatures and decreasing fall and winter flows. We increased stream temperatures by 0.06°C per year, a rate based on stream temperature trends occurring in the Pacific Northwest over the past 50 years [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref026">26</a>], reaching 3.78°C higher than baseline at the end of the study period. This final increase in stream temperature is within the range of predicted warming for the Pacific Northwest [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref039">39</a>]. We decreased mean fall flows by 0.25% (October-December) and mean winter flows by 0.49% (January-March) each year [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref027">27</a>], resulting in a gradual decrease over time that reached 15.75% below baseline for fall flows and 30.87% below baseline for winter flows at the end of the simulation. Streams of coastal Oregon generally have hydrographs dominated by rainfall, not snowmelt and, hence, key changes related to climate change are occurring during peak winter months due to decreasing rain and not during spring and summer snowmelt [
