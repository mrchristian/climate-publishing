 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our modeled findings indicate that climate change alone influences trout more strongly and consistently across our study streams than forest harvest. Climate change led to earlier fry emergence (
  <a rid="pone.0135334.g004" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135334.g004">Fig 4</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0135334.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135334.s007">S4 Table</a>), reductions in biomass of older trout, and increased biomass of young-of-year (
  <a rid="pone.0135334.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0135334.t001">Table 1</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0135334.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135334.s008">S5 Table</a>), but these changes did not consistently translate into trends toward reduced biomass over time (
  <a rid="pone.0135334.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135334.g002">Fig 2</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0135334.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135334.s005">S2 Table</a>). They did, however, collectively lead to lower biomass relative to baseline conditions (
  <a rid="pone.0135334.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0135334.t002">Table 2</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0135334.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135334.s002">S2 Fig</a>). Reductions in biomass of older trout come from both smaller-sized and reduced number of older individuals. Although other studies have similarly predicted a decrease in body size of individuals with increasing temperature from climate change, underlying mechanisms have been difficult to identify [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref067">67</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref068">68</a>]. Because it is not clear how climate change will influence the amount of drift or benthic food for trout, in our simulations, we assume that food availability does not change with temperature [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref020">20</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref021">21</a>]. Increased temperature due to climate change leads to higher metabolism in trout, but because food intake does not change trout do not grow. Under such circumstances, they either starve or they choose riskier habitat with higher predation risk, both of which lead to lower abundances. We also noted increased biomass in young-of-year in most of the cases (see empirical evidence in [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref067">67</a>]) due to reduced intraspecific competition.

   <div class="title">Trends in Fry Emergence of Trout across Scenarios.</div>
   <p>DOY from five replicate simulations when median number of modeled fry had emerged over time in Gus Creek, Pothole Creek, Rock Creek, and Upper Mainstem (UM). Scenarios include manipulations of stream temperature and flow regimes (see 
    <a rid="sec002" ref-type="sec" href="#sec002">methods</a> narrative for detail). Only significant trends (P &lt; 0.05) over time are listed and include the slope of the trend (days per decade). Negative values represent early fry emergence. Gaps in data are due to years with no fry emergence because model thresholds for spawning, egg development, or emergence were not met.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forest harvest, in contrast, had much less effect on growth and survival than climate change (
  <a rid="pone.0135334.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0135334.t001">Table 1</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0135334.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135334.s008">S5 Table</a>), and mixed responses for biomass and trends in biomass over time (increases, decreases, or no change; 
  <a rid="pone.0135334.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135334.g002">Fig 2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0135334.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135334.s002">S2 Fig</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0135334.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0135334.t002">Table 2</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0135334.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135334.s005">S2 Table</a>). It is not surprising that trout responses were minimal across streams in response to projections of forest harvest because this stressor acts as a pulsed event (where temperature and flow returned to baseline conditions within 1–2 decades). It is worth noting, however, that we only considered effects of forest harvest on stream temperature and flow, and that other influences could also have important implications. For example, changes in stream habitat associated with loss (or addition) of large wood as a result of forestry practices and stream restoration [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref069">69</a>] and changes to trout food supply following harvest [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref051">51</a>]. Therefore, consideration of these additional factors might be expected to further reinforce the importance of the specific array of local conditions mediating trout responses to multiple stressors. Additionally, we found the types of effects realized from forest harvest were important in two streams (Rock Creek and Upper Mainstem; 
  <a rid="pone.0135334.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0135334.t002">Table 2</a>) with the net effect switching from increasing biomass after the first harvest to decreasing biomass after the second harvest. The net effect switches in these streams, not because of forest harvest 
  <span class="italic">per se</span>, but rather because trout in these streams were less able to cope with instream changes from either stressor (second perturbation of forest harvest or climate change) after about 30 years.
