 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, results of this work reveal a diverse array of responses to identical changes in stream temperature and flow projected from forest harvest and climate change on four neighboring streams within the same headwater catchment. We infer that it is important to identify the array of key features at the local scale that will allow fish to resist environmental change. If we had simulated higher changes in magnitude over longer time periods, we might have expected to see greater coherence in responses. For example, recent work has shown that as the effects of climate change intensify, uncertainty regarding speciesâ€™ responses to climate become less important, relative to our uncertainty about climate itself [

As the growing importance of both land use and climate change becomes more broadly accepted and acted upon within the policy arena, there is an increasing need for approaches to clearly attribute biological responses to such changes. Although there are conditions where it is relatively straightforward to diagnose the influences of land use, climate change, or other stressors on biological responses, there are many other contexts where attribution will be substantially more complex and less certain. As this and other recent studies have shown, models based heavily in field data that are capable of addressing such complexity can allow a multitude of useful insights into interactions among local processes. Our findings provide support for continuing this line of inquiry and reveal the importance of disentangling the role of local variability in physical habitat conditions in streams under different land uses and a changing climate.
