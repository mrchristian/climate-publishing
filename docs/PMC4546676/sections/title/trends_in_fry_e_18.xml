 <div class="title">Trends in Fry Emergence of Trout across Scenarios.</div>
 <p>DOY from five replicate simulations when median number of modeled fry had emerged over time in Gus Creek, Pothole Creek, Rock Creek, and Upper Mainstem (UM). Scenarios include manipulations of stream temperature and flow regimes (see 
  <a rid="sec002" ref-type="sec" href="#sec002">methods</a> narrative for detail). Only significant trends (P &lt; 0.05) over time are listed and include the slope of the trend (days per decade). Negative values represent early fry emergence. Gaps in data are due to years with no fry emergence because model thresholds for spawning, egg development, or emergence were not met.
