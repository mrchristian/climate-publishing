 <div class="title">Trends of Differences in Summer Biomass of Trout between Scenarios and Baseline.</div>
 <p>Trends of differences in magnitude of total biomass (g) of trout in summer for forest harvest (FH), climate change (CC), and combined (FH + CC) scenarios compared to baseline in modeled streams, including Gus Creek, Pothole Creek, Rock Creek, and Upper Mainstem (UM). Annual trends in total biomass (g/decade) were averaged across five replicate simulations. They were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test and p-values were corrected for serial correlation for 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> harvest, 2
  <span class="sup">nd</span> harvest, and the entire study period. Scenarios include manipulations of stream temperature and flow regimes (see 
  <a rid="sec002" ref-type="sec" href="#sec002">Methods</a> for details). Significant p-values in bold (alpha â‰¤ 0.05) represent increasing or decreasing trends of magnitude in comparison to baseline. Magnitude is Sen slope (g/decade) over time.
