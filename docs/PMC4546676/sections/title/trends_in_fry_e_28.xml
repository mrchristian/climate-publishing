 <div class="title">Trends in Fry Emergence of Trout across Scenarios.</div>
 <p>Median DOY of fry emergence of trout for forest harvest (FH), climate change (CC), and combined (FH + CC) scenarios in four modeled streams, including Gus Creek, Pothole Creek, Rock Creek, and Upper Mainstem (UM). Annual trends in fry emergence (days/decade) were averages of the five replicate simulations and were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test and p-values were corrected for serial correlation for dates of the 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> harvest, 2
  <span class="sup">nd</span> harvest, and the entire study period. Scenarios include manipulations of stream temperature and flow regimes (see 
  <a rid="sec002" ref-type="sec" href="#sec002">Methods</a> for details). Significant p-values in bold (alpha â‰¤ 0.05) represent increasing or decreasing trends. Magnitude is the Sen slope (days/decade) over time.
