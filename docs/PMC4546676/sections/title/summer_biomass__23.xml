 <div class="title">Summer Biomass of Trout over Time.</div>
 <p>Mean total summer biomass (g) from five replicate simulations for all trout ages grouped together over time for each scenario of forest harvest (FH), climate change (CC), and their combined effects (FH+CC) compared to baseline, in Gus Creek, Pothole Creek, Rock Creek, and Upper Mainstem (UM). Scenarios include manipulations of stream temperature and regimes (see 
  <a rid="sec002" ref-type="sec" href="#sec002">methods</a> narrative for detail). Each data point represents one year of the simulation run. Line represents 1:1 ratio between the scenario and baseline. Only significant comparisons (P &lt; 0.05) are shown with values that correspond to pseudomedian of differences in biomass (g) between scenario and baseline.
