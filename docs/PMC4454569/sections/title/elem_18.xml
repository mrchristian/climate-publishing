 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population growth rate is the unifying variable linking the various facets of population ecology. It is the summary parameter of trends in population density or abundance [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref040">40</a>]. For 3 species in DBR and 77 species in BCI, the population growth rate, lnλ, is negatively correlated with time for most species. This is consistent with previous studies [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref015">15</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref021">21</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref022">22</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref044">44</a>]. However, these studies could not determine the underlying causes of a declining population growth rate over time [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref015">15</a>], or attributed this decline to environmental factors such as rainfall patterns [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref022">22</a>] and survival variation [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref015">15</a>]. The present study, however, indicates that this decreasing trend of population growth rate may be mainly a consequence of community development. When we use the exponential growth model, logistic growth model and Gaussian curve to simulate population growth, the population growth rate, lnλ, decreased over time except in the exponential growth model, where lnλ is constant (
  <a rid="pone.0126228.g007" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0126228.g007">Fig 7</a>). In addition, our multiple regression analysis showed that lnλ was negatively correlated with time for the majority of species (
  <a rid="pone.0126228.g004" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0126228.g004">Fig 4</a>). It can be concluded that for most species in a community, a decreasing population growth rate is inevitable. This is because the plant abundance and species richness will be close to the maximum environment carrying capacity with increasing population density and plant size. In the present study, community I in DBR was a mature forest; community II was in an earlier stage of succession than community I. The BCI forest was mature and relatively stable throughout the study period [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref021">21</a>]. In addition to species-specific properties, the stage of population development is important in determining how the population growth rate of one species will respond to climatic factors.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, previous studies usually measured the population growth rate by focusing on one time period and neglected to study the development of a population. Such neglect may affect predicted results because population growth rates change, and usually decrease, over time. Recently, using a specific database extracted from collected literature, a synthesis study examined how population growth rates varied within and among 50 plant species [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref015">15</a>]. They found that population growth rates could vary greatly from species to species even within the same genus. However, population growth rates of different populations within the same species were similar, particularly if geographic distances among the populations were small and environmental factors were similar. These results can be explained by the present study, which demonstrates that the population growth rate of one species is not constant and is likely determined by the stage of community development and population growth. Different species usually appear at different stages of community development and have their own individual population growth parameters, even if they belong to the same genus [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref015">15</a>]. Consequently, population growth rates vary greatly when species from different communities of different development stages are compared. Alternatively, nearby populations of the same species always belong to similar communities of nearly the same development stage. Therefore, populations with similar population growth rates may be geographically closer to each other.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variations in environmental factors have substantial effects on plant population dynamics and are considered essential for realistic models of population dynamics [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref045">45</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref046">46</a>]. Temporal variation in environmental factors is important to population dynamics in terms of both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref047">47</a>]. Experimental warming has consistently produced an increase in vascular plant growth across the Arctic [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref048">48</a>]. A recent study assessed the climate drivers of recent unfavourable silversword population dynamics and found that the declining population growth rates of silversword were associated with changing climatic conditions. Annual population growth rates were strongly tied to rainfall patterns [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref022">22</a>]. A modelling study of a steppe plant community from eastern Idaho, USA, found strong effects of climate on the population growth in 2 of 3 target species. A 1% decrease in the previous year’s precipitation would lead to a 0.6% decrease in population growth for one species, and a 1% increase in summer temperature would result in a 1.3% increase in population growth for the other species [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref049">49</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, our study shows that an increasing annual mean temperature would increase population growth rates for the majority of species. However, a decreasing annual precipitation would also increase population growth rate in both DBR and BCI. This conflicts with other studies. One explanation is the persistent directional change in the flora toward an increased abundance of drought-tolerant species, possibly due to increasing temperature and/or a past decrease in rainfall, at least in BCI [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref021">21</a>]. Another possible explanation is that during succession, as shade intolerant tree species gradually decline, the community tends to approach a climax that is dominated by mesophytic tree species [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref050">50</a>], which might be favoured by less precipitation.
