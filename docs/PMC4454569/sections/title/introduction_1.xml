 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been widely predicted that global climate change will affect biodiversity [

  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref003">3</a>], species distribution and population growth [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref004">4</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref006">6</a>]. Forests, as indispensable resources on Earth, have tremendous ecological, economic, social, and aesthetic value. Tree species distribution and forest composition will undergo substantial shifts in the future [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref011">11</a>]. Changes in forest community composition may exert impacts on net primary productivity and carbon storage [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref013">13</a>]. It is essential to determine how climate factors influence forest population growth and community composition [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref014">14</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Average population growth rates are usually expected to be stable, but patterns of variation in population growth rates are different for different species. Variation in population growth rates is related to species birth, growth, reproduction and death [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref008">8</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref015">15</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref017">17</a>]. A recent study considered forest population dynamics, particularly the rate at which forest distributions might shift under climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref006">6</a>]. Change in a forest community is related to species-specific responses of the tree species in that community to climate change. In terms of population dynamics, dominant species respond differently to changing environmental conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref018">18</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref019">19</a>], thereby giving rise to a change in community composition. For instance, Feeley et al. (2007) [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref020">20</a>] found a widespread decrease in tree growth rates for species occurring in large forested dynamic plots at Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI), and the changes in growth were significantly associated with regional climate changes. Not long after, the authors revealed that, in this same plot, there have been consistent, directional changes in the tree species composition towards a significantly greater representation of species with greater drought tolerance, which was consistent with long-term climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref021">21</a>]. Declines of population growth rates were found in other studies, and these declines were usually climate-correlated [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref022">22</a>]. Furthermore, traditional analyses usually assume that tree species composition or population growth rate is constant and fail to capture the temporal dynamics of these factors, making it difficult to attribute the change to environmental conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref020">20</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref022">22</a>]. Thus, quantifying the temporal growth dynamics of population in the context of community change when the influences of climate variations are of interest is necessary.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tropical and subtropical forests are major biodiversity hotspots harbouring many species and are recognised as important global carbon sinks and sources [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref018">18</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref019">19</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref023">23</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref025">25</a>]. Long-term directional changes in the community composition of tropical forests have been reported recently, and these changes have been attributed to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref021">21</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref026">26</a>]. Studies have analysed the effects of climate change on the composition of various plant communities in many areas, including deserts [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref027">27</a>], grasslands [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref028">28</a>]and lowland forests [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref029">29</a>]. Actually, climate-driven impacts on long-term community changes are difficult to disentangle from changes driven by stand development [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref030">30</a>]. Although, the causes underlying these changes, specifically the contribution of long-term climate change vs. successional recovery from past disturbances, remain debated [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref021">21</a>]. To increase the accuracy and reliability of the assessment, the community development process should be considered when one examines the effects of climate change on community composition change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand the effects of temporal environmental changes on community composition, it is important to identify the rates at which species have already responded to recent climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref031">31</a>]. Studies have indicated that climate change influences community composition [
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref032">32</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref033">33</a>], but few quantified the influence of climate change on community composition change. To better understand the dynamics of community composition in a changing world, it is necessary to quantify community composition change rate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herein, we aimed first to compose a method for calculating the community composition change rate and to examine the influence of climate factors on community composition change using two long-term forest datasets (the observation data from DBR and BCI). Second, we aimed to conduct a linear model to separate the impacts of climate factors and time factors on species-specific population growth rate and to testify the impacts of relatively faster climate change on community composition change rate within a relatively short period (several decades).</p>
