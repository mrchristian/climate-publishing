  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We employed two long-term datasets for use in our analysis. One is a dataset containing 30 years of data from DBR (Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, Guangdong province, China); the other contains approximately 25 years of data from BCI (Barro Colorado Island, Panama). DBR has a subtropical climate, and BCI has a tropical climate. Rare species were not included in this study, because they are more sensitive to disturbance and the variations of their numbers are more stochastic.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DBR (23°10′N, 112°35′E) has a monsoon climate and is located in a subtropical, moist forest life zone. The annual mean temperature is 22.3°C and the annual mean rainfall is 1678 mm with a distinct seasonal pattern. Monthly average air temperature and precipitation, representing DBR's climatic regime, were obtained from the Gaoyao weather station [
   <a rid="pone.0126228.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref034">34</a>]. The reserve is dominated by regional climax, evergreen broadleaf forest represented by the 
   <span class="italic">Cryptocarya</span> community, which is dominated by 
   <span class="italic">Cryptocarya chinensis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Cryptocarya concinna</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Castanopsis chinensis</span>. Abundance of the 3 dominant species in two communities was investigated 9 times from 1955 to 1985. One community was 
   <span class="italic">Cryptocarya</span> community, which was at the relatively stable stage; the other community was 
   <span class="italic">Pinus-Castanopsis-Schima</span> community, which was at a relatively early stage of succession. There were very few human activities in the study area until 1980s and there was no big pest outbreak before 1985[
   <a rid="pone.0126228.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref035">35</a>]. More than twelve 10×10 m
   <span class="sup">2</span> quadrates were investigated in each of the communities. The average abundance (number of individuals) of 3 species in 2 communities for every investigation was recorded [
   <a rid="pone.0126228.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref036">36</a>] (
   <a rid="pone.0126228.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0126228.s003">S1 Table</a>). The climate data for monthly temperature and precipitation in DBR were provided by Guoyi Zhou (2012, pers. comm., 5 September).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The BCI plot (9°9'N, 79°51'W) covers an area of 50 ha; it was the first plot established by the CTFS (Center for Tropical Forest Science) and is undoubtedly one of the best-studied forests in the world [
   <a rid="pone.0126228.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref021">21</a>]. The island receives an average of 2634 mm of rain per year, with a pronounced four-month dry season from mid-December through mid-April [
   <a rid="pone.0126228.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref037">37</a>]. Daytime temperatures reach an average of 32°C, with night-time lows of approximately 23°C. This island has 1500 ha of diverse, moist, lowland, tropical forest, and has been protected from human disturbance for 70 years [
   <a rid="pone.0126228.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref038">38</a>]. Abundance data collected from 1981 to 2005 on the 50 ha plot were obtained from the Center for Tropical Forest Science (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ctfs.si.edu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.ctfs.si.edu/</span>) and monthly climate data were provided by Steven Paton (2012, pers. comm., 23 October). There were 319 species recorded for woody stems ≥ 10 mm diameter at breast height. Among these species, only species with an average of at least 10 individuals per ha for 6 censuses were included in our analysis because large percentage changes in abundance of rare species could be caused by minor, chance events [
   <a rid="pone.0126228.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref039">39</a>]. Consequently, we finalised a list of 77 species for analysis (
   <a rid="pone.0126228.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0126228.s004">S2 Table</a>). The total abundance of 77 species accounted for 91 percent of the total individuals on the plot.

We obtained 8 sequential intervals in DBR and 5 sequential intervals in BCI to estimate the species-specific population growth rate. Once the population growth rates were estimated, we determined the direction and rates of change in the parameters by calculating the linear least-squares regression coefficient (β) of lnλ vs. time separately for each of the species. For BCI, we also analysed the distribution of β to see the overall trend of population growth. We also analysed the relationship between the correlation coefficient and the abundance of each species to explore whether there is any influence of abundance on population growth rate.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climatic factors in population growth and community composition change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two basic models (the unrestricted exponential growth model and the restricted logistic growth model) are often used to simulate continuous population growth. Almost all populations undergo three phases: the increasing phase, the stabilising phase and the decreasing phase, but neither of the two models is able to describe the population declining stage. The interaction of three fundamental processes—(i) competition for resources, (ii) the effect of body size on resource use and (iii) the effect of plant density on growth and mortality—will affect the development of plant populations [
   <a rid="pone.0126228.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0126228.ref043">43</a>]. Given enough time, every population will decline. The limitation may come from the external environment or the self-limiting of a species. Although the logistic growth model has frequently been used in forest ecology, species replacement during forest development makes the population growth of the majority of species more likely to resemble a Gaussian curve (
