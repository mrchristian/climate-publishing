 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated the community composition change rate, Slnλ, based on the census data and the fitted data, separately. The fitted data were estimated based on the 
  <a rid="pone.0126228.e003" ref-type="disp-formula" href="#pone.0126228.e003">Eq 3</a>. At first we calculated Slnλs for every adjacent census. The results showed that the fitted value and the true value displayed approximately the same variations over time in BCI (
  <a rid="pone.0126228.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0126228.g005">Fig 5E</a>), while the variations of the fitted value and the true value for the two communities in DBR appeared to be different (
  <a rid="pone.0126228.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0126228.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</a>). We noticed that the census intervals of DBR were very different, from 1 to 11 years for community I and 1 to 23 years in community II. So we combined some short intervals and recalculated the values and found that the fitted value and the true value displayed approximately the same variations (
  <a rid="pone.0126228.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0126228.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</a>). The results suggest that when the community composition change rate is used as an index to compare different communities or different census times for one community, the time intervals should be identical.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The linear regression analysis between climate factors and community composition change rate, Slnλ, showed that climate factors had no significant effects on Slnλ except on the maximum and minimum temperature in DBR and the minimum temperature in BCI. The maximum temperature had a positive effect on Slnλ, while the minimum temperature had a positive effect in DBR but a negative effect in BCI. The overall trend seems to link increasing temperature with increasing community composition change rate (5 in 6 regressions) (
