  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We studied the effect of a range of temperatures on two phryganic Lamiaceae species in Greece to evaluate the potential threat of climate change to floral nectar production and plant–pollinator interactions in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean region is considered to be particularly threatened by global warming in the future due to strongly elevated temperatures and a heightened probability of drought during the summer (

   </a>). The average summer temperatures across the Mediterranean between 1961 and 1990 were between ∼22.5 and 30 °C (
   <a rid="PLV111C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C24">New 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 1999
   </a>) but the climate warming scenarios now predict a 0.9–1.2 °C of warming for the summer months over the next two decades and up to 4–5 °C temperature increase before the end of the century (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strongly elevated temperatures, predicted to prevail in the Mediterranean region in the end of the century, would likely decrease nectar secretion and sugar production in both 
   <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> and 
   <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>, which based on our results, currently grow in the wild at or close to their optimum temperature range for nectar secretion. This effect can be particularly strong in regions of the Mediterranean where the current average temperatures are higher. Strongly elevated temperatures in the climate chamber decreased sugar content per plant of both 
   <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> and 
   <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> (Figs

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>E). High temperatures induce physiological stress in plants, which decreases nectar production per flower (

   <a rid="PLV111C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C39">Scaven and Rafferty 2013</a>) and can cause plants to produce fewer flowers (
   <a rid="PLV111C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C38">Saavedra 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2003
   </a>). Extreme climate warming could consequently have a negative effect on nectar production and hence on the phryganic communities, where Lamiaceae are a dominant plant group (
   <a rid="PLV111C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C32">Petanidou and Vokou 1993</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moderate warming predicted for the next two decades, however, should have only a moderate effect on 
   <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> nectar secretion, remaining close to this species’ optimum range, and even promote nectar production of 
   <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>, which demonstrated a relatively high optimal temperature for nectar volume per flower (30–35 °C; Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>A) and sugar content per flower (∼29 °C; Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>C). Similarly high temperature optimum (32.5 °C during the day, analogous to the optimal daily temperatures of 
   <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>) has also been found for the sugar content per flower of 
   <span class="italic">Thymus capitatus</span>, another phryganic species (
   <a rid="PLV111C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C31">Petanidou and Smets 1996</a>). In species with similarly high temperature optima, climate change can potentially increase nectar production, at least in the case of moderate warming. However, sugar content per plant of 
   <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> peaked at lower temperatures (optimum ∼26–27 °C; Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>D) than sugar content per flower, indicating that the nectar production per plant could still be negatively affected by even moderate warming, even if sugar content per flower can still increase under higher temperatures. The effect of moderate warming on the sugar content per plant of 
   <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>, as well as 
   <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> sugar content per flower (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" href="#PLV111F1">1</a>C) and sugar content per plant (optimum ∼25–27 °C; Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" href="#PLV111F1">1</a>D), might in the near future be promoted in some regions of the Mediterranean with lower average temperatures, or be moderately decreased in regions with higher temperatures.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to nectar and sugar production, trait variation (CV) within a plant was not related to temperature in most of the tested traits. Only CV of sugar concentration was positively related to temperature indoors (in both species) and positively unimodally related to temperature outdoors (in 
   <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span>). Changes in the variation of nectar production can decrease plant attractiveness to pollinators (
   <a rid="PLV111C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C37">Real and Rathcke 1988</a>; 
   <a rid="PLV111C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C49">Zimmerman 1988</a>; 
   <a rid="PLV111C41" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C41">Shafir 2000</a>), thus having a negative impact on plant pollination and consequently on plant reproduction and population persistence (
   <a rid="PLV111C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C39">Scaven and Rafferty 2013</a>). Nevertheless, the stability of trait variation patterns in our experiment signifies that in these two species this aspect of plant–pollinator interactions could be relatively unaffected by elevated temperatures and not cause additional alterations under climate warming.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moderate warming can be beneficial for nectar production at least as long as the plants are not water stressed. The Mediterranean plants are indeed well adapted to cope with the hot and dry conditions during the flowering period (
   <a rid="PLV111C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C29">Petanidou 2007</a>). However, different scenarios of climate change predict a substantial decrease in summer precipitation in the Mediterranean region in addition to increased temperatures (
   <a rid="PLV111C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C13">Giorgi and Lionello 2008</a>;

   </a>; 
   <a rid="PLV111C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C18">IPCC 2013</a>). Consequently, the actual effect of climate warming with additional water stress (
   <a rid="PLV111C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C47">Villarreal and Freeman 1990</a>; 
   <a rid="PLV111C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C4">Carroll 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2001
   </a>) could further increase the negative effect of elevated temperatures on nectar production in the phryganic systems. The combined effect of temperature and drought on plants and their ability to adapt to future climate changes in this region still needs further study.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in species' response to global warming</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our two study species responded to the elevated temperatures somewhat differently, which suggests possible disparate responses to climate change in phryganic species. For one, 
   <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> optimal temperatures for nectar and sugar production were in general lower, close to the current average temperatures, and the species therefore more sensitive to climate warming than 
   <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>, which had higher optimal temperatures for nectar secretion (Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" href="#PLV111F1">1</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>). Additionally, several traits of 
   <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> exhibited dependence on elevated temperatures (nectar volume per flower, sugar content per flower and number of flowers per plant) in addition to the effect of time through the flowering period. On the other hand, in 
   <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> it was only nectar volume per flower that clearly depended on elevated temperatures. Strong dependence on temperature implies that 
   <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> could be rather sensitive to temperature changes, whereas 
   <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> might be more moderately affected by climate warming.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences in species' nectar production patterns could be caused by the plants' adaptations to the different phryganic microhabitats, which the two species inhabit—
   <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> prefers modified or somewhat protected microhabitats (understorey, partially shaded, neighbouring to different structures), while 
   <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> grows under full sun (
   <a rid="PLV111C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C31">Petanidou and Smets 1996</a>; 
   <a rid="PLV111C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C34">Petanidou 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2000
   </a>). As a plant of open natural areas, 
   <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> is adapted to particularly high temperatures and does not experience physiological stress at moderately higher than average temperatures, akin to other open phryganic species, such as 
   <span class="italic">Thymus capitatus</span>, which has a similarly high optimal temperature range for nectar sugar production (
   <a rid="PLV111C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C31">Petanidou and Smets 1996</a>). At the same time, 
   <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> as a plant of less exposed habitats could be less adapted to the heat and considerably more sensitive to temperature rise. This difference suggests a stronger effect of climate change on understorey plants in the phryganic systems, which are less adapted to high temperatures and the effect of drought. At the same time, species that are adapted to the harsh conditions of the open phrygana might be able to cope better with the forthcoming changes.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effect of global warming on Mediterranean pollinators</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results demonstrate that in case of moderate warming, as predicted in the Mediterranean region for the next two decades, nectar sugar production and consequently the amount of resources available for pollinators could be moderately adversely affected in the case of some Mediterranean species (e.g. 
   <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span>) and might even be benefitted in others (e.g. 
   <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>). This difference in species responses suggests that at the community level species nectar production might be able to balance out, at least for the more generalized pollinators (
   <a rid="PLV111C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C39">Scaven and Rafferty 2013</a>). Nevertheless, in the case of more extreme warming, as predicted for the end of the century, nectar production of both species is expected to decrease.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both our study species are among the highest nectar producers in phrygana (
   <a rid="PLV111C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C30">Petanidou and Smets 1995</a>) and are therefore an essential resource for a number of pollinator species (
   <a rid="PLV111C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C32">Petanidou and Vokou 1993</a>; T. Petanidou 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>., unpubl.). Due to the greater sensitivity of 
   <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> to elevated temperatures, the effect of climate warming could be more pronounced on the pollinators of this species already during the next few decades under the effect of moderate warming. Although plant–pollinator networks, especially generalist interactions, are expected to be rather robust to the effect of climate change (

    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2013

    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2004
   </a>). Even if the plant and pollinator populations are able to persist for some time, the strength of interactions can be changed due to alterations in plant resources and pollinator behaviour and thus still significantly affect the mutualistic interaction networks due to climate warming (
   <a rid="PLV111C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C23">Memmott

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, experimental warming in the climate chamber accelerated plant flowering and thus reduced the length of flowering period under elevated temperatures. Under natural conditions, shorter flowering time in consequence of global warming could increase the probability of creating temporal mismatches with pollinators (
   <a rid="PLV111C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C23">Memmott

   <a rid="PLV111C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C8">DeLucia 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2012
   </a>). Since Lamiaceae are the most essential group for the pollinators in the phryganic systems in summer (

   <a rid="PLV111C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C29">Petanidou 2007</a>), the reduced nectar secretion and temporal mismatches with these species at strongly elevated temperatures could have a considerable impact on the phryganic pollinator fauna. In addition, it could also negatively affect apiculture in the Mediterranean region, which in the phryganic systems is strongly dependent on the abundance and nectar production of different Lamiaceae species (
