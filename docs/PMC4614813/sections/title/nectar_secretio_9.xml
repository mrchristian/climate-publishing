 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We studied the effect of a range of temperatures on two phryganic Lamiaceae species in Greece to evaluate the potential threat of climate change to floral nectar production and plant–pollinator interactions in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean region is considered to be particularly threatened by global warming in the future due to strongly elevated temperatures and a heightened probability of drought during the summer (

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2012
  </a>). The average summer temperatures across the Mediterranean between 1961 and 1990 were between ∼22.5 and 30 °C (
  <a rid="PLV111C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C24">New 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 1999
  </a>) but the climate warming scenarios now predict a 0.9–1.2 °C of warming for the summer months over the next two decades and up to 4–5 °C temperature increase before the end of the century (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strongly elevated temperatures, predicted to prevail in the Mediterranean region in the end of the century, would likely decrease nectar secretion and sugar production in both 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> and 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>, which based on our results, currently grow in the wild at or close to their optimum temperature range for nectar secretion. This effect can be particularly strong in regions of the Mediterranean where the current average temperatures are higher. Strongly elevated temperatures in the climate chamber decreased sugar content per plant of both 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> and 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" href="#PLV111F1">1</a>D and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>D) by decreasing the volume of nectar produced per flower (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" href="#PLV111F1">1</a>C and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>C) and the number of flowers per plant (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" href="#PLV111F1">1</a>E and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>E). High temperatures induce physiological stress in plants, which decreases nectar production per flower (
  <a rid="PLV111C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C31">Petanidou and Smets 1996</a>; 
  <a rid="PLV111C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C26">Pacini and Nepi 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="PLV111C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C39">Scaven and Rafferty 2013</a>) and can cause plants to produce fewer flowers (
  <a rid="PLV111C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C38">Saavedra 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2003
  </a>). Extreme climate warming could consequently have a negative effect on nectar production and hence on the phryganic communities, where Lamiaceae are a dominant plant group (
  <a rid="PLV111C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C32">Petanidou and Vokou 1993</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moderate warming predicted for the next two decades, however, should have only a moderate effect on 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> nectar secretion, remaining close to this species’ optimum range, and even promote nectar production of 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>, which demonstrated a relatively high optimal temperature for nectar volume per flower (30–35 °C; Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>A) and sugar content per flower (∼29 °C; Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>C). Similarly high temperature optimum (32.5 °C during the day, analogous to the optimal daily temperatures of 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>) has also been found for the sugar content per flower of 
  <span class="italic">Thymus capitatus</span>, another phryganic species (
  <a rid="PLV111C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C31">Petanidou and Smets 1996</a>). In species with similarly high temperature optima, climate change can potentially increase nectar production, at least in the case of moderate warming. However, sugar content per plant of 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> peaked at lower temperatures (optimum ∼26–27 °C; Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>D) than sugar content per flower, indicating that the nectar production per plant could still be negatively affected by even moderate warming, even if sugar content per flower can still increase under higher temperatures. The effect of moderate warming on the sugar content per plant of 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>, as well as 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> sugar content per flower (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" href="#PLV111F1">1</a>C) and sugar content per plant (optimum ∼25–27 °C; Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" href="#PLV111F1">1</a>D), might in the near future be promoted in some regions of the Mediterranean with lower average temperatures, or be moderately decreased in regions with higher temperatures.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to nectar and sugar production, trait variation (CV) within a plant was not related to temperature in most of the tested traits. Only CV of sugar concentration was positively related to temperature indoors (in both species) and positively unimodally related to temperature outdoors (in 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span>). Changes in the variation of nectar production can decrease plant attractiveness to pollinators (
  <a rid="PLV111C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C37">Real and Rathcke 1988</a>; 
  <a rid="PLV111C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C49">Zimmerman 1988</a>; 
  <a rid="PLV111C41" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C41">Shafir 2000</a>), thus having a negative impact on plant pollination and consequently on plant reproduction and population persistence (
  <a rid="PLV111C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C39">Scaven and Rafferty 2013</a>). Nevertheless, the stability of trait variation patterns in our experiment signifies that in these two species this aspect of plant–pollinator interactions could be relatively unaffected by elevated temperatures and not cause additional alterations under climate warming.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moderate warming can be beneficial for nectar production at least as long as the plants are not water stressed. The Mediterranean plants are indeed well adapted to cope with the hot and dry conditions during the flowering period (
  <a rid="PLV111C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C29">Petanidou 2007</a>). However, different scenarios of climate change predict a substantial decrease in summer precipitation in the Mediterranean region in addition to increased temperatures (
  <a rid="PLV111C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C13">Giorgi and Lionello 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="PLV111C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C11">Giannakopoulos

  </a>; 
  <a rid="PLV111C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C18">IPCC 2013</a>). Consequently, the actual effect of climate warming with additional water stress (
  <a rid="PLV111C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C47">Villarreal and Freeman 1990</a>; 
  <a rid="PLV111C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C4">Carroll 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2001
  </a>) could further increase the negative effect of elevated temperatures on nectar production in the phryganic systems. The combined effect of temperature and drought on plants and their ability to adapt to future climate changes in this region still needs further study.
