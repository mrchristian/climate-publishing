  <span class="italic">Ballota acetabulosa</span> (L.) Benth. and 
  <span class="italic">Teucrium divaricatum</span> Sieber ex Heldr. Both species inhabit the same phryganic communities, but prefer to grow in different microhabitats. While 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> often grows near stony structures or walls (e.g. abandoned agricultural terraces) or in places partially shaded by taller vegetation (e.g. in dehesa type scrub) (
