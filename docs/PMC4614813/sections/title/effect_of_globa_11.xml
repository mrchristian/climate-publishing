 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results demonstrate that in case of moderate warming, as predicted in the Mediterranean region for the next two decades, nectar sugar production and consequently the amount of resources available for pollinators could be moderately adversely affected in the case of some Mediterranean species (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span>) and might even be benefitted in others (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>). This difference in species responses suggests that at the community level species nectar production might be able to balance out, at least for the more generalized pollinators (
  <a rid="PLV111C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C39">Scaven and Rafferty 2013</a>). Nevertheless, in the case of more extreme warming, as predicted for the end of the century, nectar production of both species is expected to decrease.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both our study species are among the highest nectar producers in phrygana (
  <a rid="PLV111C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C30">Petanidou and Smets 1995</a>) and are therefore an essential resource for a number of pollinator species (

  <span class="italic">et al</span>., unpubl.). Due to the greater sensitivity of 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> to elevated temperatures, the effect of climate warming could be more pronounced on the pollinators of this species already during the next few decades under the effect of moderate warming. Although plantâ€“pollinator networks, especially generalist interactions, are expected to be rather robust to the effect of climate change (

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2013
  </a>), the loss of a generalist plant species can still be a considerable risk for the population persistence of pollinators (
  <a rid="PLV111C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C22">Memmott 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2004
  </a>). Even if the plant and pollinator populations are able to persist for some time, the strength of interactions can be changed due to alterations in plant resources and pollinator behaviour and thus still significantly affect the mutualistic interaction networks due to climate warming (

Under natural conditions, shorter flowering time in consequence of global warming could increase the probability of creating temporal mismatches with pollinators (

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2012
  </a>). Since Lamiaceae are the most essential group for the pollinators in the phryganic systems in summer (

  <a rid="PLV111C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C29">Petanidou 2007</a>), the reduced nectar secretion and temporal mismatches with these species at strongly elevated temperatures could have a considerable impact on the phryganic pollinator fauna. In addition, it could also negatively affect apiculture in the Mediterranean region, which in the phryganic systems is strongly dependent on the abundance and nectar production of different Lamiaceae species (
