 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All tested traits of 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>, except sugar concentration per flower, were significantly positively unimodally related to temperature in combination with time in the climate chamber (Table

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>). Nectar volume and flower sugar content per flower of 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> peaked at higher average temperatures (∼29–33 °C; Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>A and C) than the number of flowers per plant produced per day (∼24–25 °C; Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>E). Sugar content per plant was therefore greatest at ∼26–27 °C (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>D). Trait variation (CV) of flower traits was not related to elevated temperatures in most of the studied traits, except CV of sugar concentration [

  </span>]. In the outdoor group, only two traits showed a significant relationship to average temperature; the number of flowers per plant decreased with increasing temperatures and biomass per flower was positively unimodally related to temperature (Table 
  <a rid="PLV111TB2" ref-type="table" href="#PLV111TB2">2</a>). Most of the outdoor models also had very low marginal coefficients of determination (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>m), showing that much of the variation was explained by differences between individual plants and not by temperature (Table 
  <a rid="PLV111TB2" ref-type="table" href="#PLV111TB2">2</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparing the response between the climate chamber and the outdoor group in response to time showed a difference in nectar volume per flower, number of flowers per plant and biomass per flower (Table 
  <a rid="PLV111TB3" ref-type="table" href="#PLV111TB3">3</a> and

  </span>). Number of flowers per plant and biomass per flower also showed a separate response to temperature in the outdoor models (Table 
  <a rid="PLV111TB2" ref-type="table" href="#PLV111TB2">2</a>), thus it is more difficult to say how much of the difference could be caused by the elevated temperatures in the climate chamber

  </span>. However, the difference in the case of nectar volume per flower is likely caused by the effect of elevated temperatures in the climate chamber
