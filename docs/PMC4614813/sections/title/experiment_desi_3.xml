 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants of 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> used in the experiment were grown from seeds collected from the I. &amp; A. Diomedes Botanical Garden of Athens University in 2005. Seeds were sown in October 2013, potted as seedlings, and grown outdoors until flowering. As for 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>, entire plants were collected from a natural population on Lesvos Island in October 2013, potted and grown outdoors until they were in bloom, ready to be used in the experiment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experiment was conducted at the University of the Aegean in Mytilene on Lesvos Island. Both study species were subjected to the same treatments simultaneously. For each species, two groups of plants were considered. One treatment group (15 plants per species) was tested under different temperature regimes in a climate chamber (Walk-in GRW-20 CMP 3/TBLIN, CDR Chryssagis™) and the second treatment group (six plants per species) was grown outdoors under naturally varying temperature and air humidity conditions. Comparing the two treatments allows us to estimate the effect of temperature separately from the effect of time and thus see, whether the trends are driven solely by temperature or whether they may be partially caused by the plants’ intrinsic limitations (e.g. exhausted nutrient reserves), which plants naturally incur during their flowering period. Some of the initial plants (one for 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> in the climate chamber, and 16 for 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>, of which 11 in the climate chamber and 5 outdoors) were replaced with new ones during the experiment when they got close to the end of their flowering period, in order to have the same number of flowering plants at all tested temperatures. Altogether, including the replacement plants, 22 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> and 38 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> plants were employed. Each plant was labelled with a unique number and considered as a separate entity in the subsequent analyses. The experiment for both species lasted from 24 May to 17 June 2014 in the climate chamber and in the outdoors from 24 May to 8 July 2014, following the plants through the flowering period both in the climate chamber and outdoors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the climate chamber, a 14-h photoperiod was used for both species, corresponding to the natural day length at the time of the year. A mixture of plant growth fluorescent lamps (Gro-lux) and low-pressure sodium lamps were used, with a total light intensity of ∼800 μmol m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> s
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (∼43 000 lx) over the waveband 400–700 nm in the chamber. Light intensity in the chamber was somewhat lower than what the plants would experience in nature; however, the intensity was constant throughout the days, compensating for the lower intensity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate chamber experiment for both species was started at the lowest temperatures, and the temperature was increased every 3 days by 3 °C increments. Tested 24 h average temperatures ranged from 17.5 to 38.5 °C (day temperatures 20–41 °C, night temperatures always 6 °C lower, corresponding to the approximate natural difference between day and night temperatures at the time of the year). Tested temperatures were chosen to cover a range around the long-term (1958–2001) June average temperature of ∼26 °C according to Elefsis weather station near Athens, Greece, but including also elevated temperatures at least up to the temperatures predicted by climate change scenarios (
  <a rid="PLV111C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C18">IPCC 2013</a>) to test for the effect of future climate warming. Relative air humidity was kept constant at 60 ± 5% during the day and 80 ± 5% during the night, corresponding approximately to current natural conditions. Plants were watered on the first day of every temperature step to avoid water stress.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants in the outdoor group were placed in an open area in full sunlight and were covered with large and airy tulle cages to prevent pollinator visits. The light intensity inside the covered cages was higher than in the climate chamber (∼1400 μmol m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> s
  <span class="sup">−1</span> or ∼75 000 lx). Data on ambient temperatures outdoors were obtained from the nearby (&lt;300 m) climate station at the University of the Aegean in Mytilene (
  <span xlink:href="http://catastrophes.geo.aegean.gr/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://catastrophes.geo.aegean.gr/</span>). The average temperature of the 3 days corresponding to each temperature step in the climate chamber was used in the analyses. The mean outdoor temperature during the test period ranged from 16.7 to 26.1 °C.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nectar measurements both in the climate chamber and in the outdoor group were taken between 1230 and 1700 h on Day 3 of each temperature step, to give the plants in the climate chamber time to adjust to the changed conditions before sampling. Flowers were sampled on the first day of anthesis following 
  <a rid="PLV111C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C31">Petanidou and Smets (1996)</a>. To ensure that only first day flowers were sampled, all open flowers were removed on Day 2, 24 h before nectar collection. Nectar was extracted from flowers with Drummond microcaps
  <span class="sup">®</span> (2 and 1 μL for 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span>; 0.5 μL for 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>), using a single flower per sample. Three flowers per plant, selected randomly from among the flowers directly exposed to light, were sampled for nectar volume and sugar concentration per flower. Nectar sugar concentration of each of the sampled flowers was measured by using special hand refractometers for small nectar volumes (Bellingham &amp; Stanley LTD, Tunbridge Wells). After sampling, the same three flowers per plant that were sampled for nectar were dried at 50 °C for 12 h and their biomass per flower was weighed (calyx and corolla together). All flowers, which had opened during the previous 24 h were counted and removed after nectar sampling on Day 3 before proceeding to the next temperature set.
