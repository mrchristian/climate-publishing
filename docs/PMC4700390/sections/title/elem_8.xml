  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the future scenarios, the area with temperatures most suitable for year-round (12 months) transmission contracted (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2a vs. 2c</a>). In particular, there was a reduction in the total land area with temperatures suitable for high year-round transmission. The hotspot of most suitable temperatures year round shifted from central Africa to the Albertine Rift region in the East, and to Angola, Gabon, and Cameroon in the West by 2080. Western Africa, particularly along the coast of Ghana, ceased to have optimal temperatures for year-round transmission. Future temperatures are predicted to promote a mix of episodic most and high transmission due to warmer temperatures exceeding the upper limit of 34°C for transmission. In contrast, high seasonal transmission potential (4–8 months) expanded throughout southern Africa and Madagascar (
