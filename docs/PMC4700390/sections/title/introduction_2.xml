  <span class="sc">alaria causes an estimated</span> 584,000 deaths a year, mostly due to 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium falciparum</span> and mostly in sub-Saharan Africa (World Health Organization 
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">2014</a>). This substantial health burden is anticipated to increase with changing climate (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">2007a</a>, Shuman 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2010</a>, Parham et al. 
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">2015</a> and references therein). Many factors impact malaria burden, including climate, land use, socioeconomic conditions, and intervention efforts (Johnson et al. 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">2014</a>). In particular, the temperature sensitivity of mosquitoes and parasites limits the transmission potential in a given location, and temperature has been shown to be an important predictor of malaria incidence in many areas (Pascual et al. 
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">2006</a>). Because insect and parasite physiology constrain malaria transmission to temperatures between 17°C and 34°C (Mordecai et al. 
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">2013</a>), temperature places limits on the spatial and temporal distribution of malaria transmission. Climate-induced shifts in distribution will impact the efficacy of intervention and vector control efforts (Siraj et al. 
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">2014</a>). As a result, accurately modeling how temperature limits transmission is essential to our understanding of the current and future distribution of malaria on the landscape (Snow et al. 
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">1996</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Control measures can interrupt malaria transmission where climate conditions are suitable (Gething et al. 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">2010</a>), making it difficult to predict climate suitability for transmission using statistical models of observed malaria transmission (human case data). An alternative is to use physiological (or process-based) models of transmission that explicitly link environmental drivers, in this case temperature, with transmission potential, to build maps of suitability. Mordecai et al. (
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">2013</a>) proposed a physiological model to assess the range of temperatures most suitable for malaria transmission. Specifically, the model incorporated the thermal ecology of anopheline mosquitoes (particularly 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles gambiae</span>, the major vector of malaria in Africa) and 
  <span class="italic">P. falciparum,</span> the major malaria parasite. This model included biologically relevant unimodal physiological responses of all entomological and parasite life history traits to temperature, derived from empirical data. Including these explicit thermal responses reduced the predicted optimal temperature for malaria transmission by 6°C from previous model estimates—from 31°C to 25°C. Additionally, the predicted lower bounds for transmission decreased from around 20°C to 17°C, and the upper bounds decreased from 40°C to 34°C (Mordecai et al. 
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">2013</a>). Model predictions aligned closely with climate-matched field observations of the entomological inoculation rate (EIR, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 122), over a period of 40 years (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a> in Mordecai et al. 
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">2013</a>,).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These differences in temperature limits should alter predicted spatial patterns of malaria transmissibility as the climate changes. More specifically, this model alters predictions of where climate both promotes and prevents transmission (Lafferty 
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">2009</a>, Rohr et al. 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">2011</a>). Process-based models generate suitability predictions that are independent of observed prevalence data (rather than fitted to it) and not confounded by control efforts or socioeconomic factors. Thus, this model provides a baseline prediction for the impacts of temperature in determining large-scale patterns of malaria transmissibility, to which more local effects (
  <span class="italic">e.g</span>., water availability, topography, or control measures) can be added to improve predictions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of the Mordecai et al. (
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">2013</a>) model, we mapped malaria temperature suitability, seasonality, and transmission duration under current and predicted future climate scenarios, incorporating restrictions on moisture availability. We then combined these with human population density estimates to emphasize changes in the relative risk of changing temperatures to human populations living in areas suitable for malaria transmission. We did not measure absolute transmission risk because other factors, including socioeconomic conditions, urbanization, and control measures, affect the realized transmission rate (Gething et al. 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">2010</a>). We mapped the relative intensity of conditions for transmission, because when conditions are highly suitable for transmission, transmission rate may not strongly correlate with prevalence (Beier et al. 
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">1999</a>) but will likely be mediated by human exposure behavior.
