 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maps based on a model with realistic assumptions about thermal physiology of anopheline mosquitoes made novel predictions about the relationship between climate change and malaria transmission suitability. Specifically, temperatures across a large area of Africa are currently more suitable for malaria transmission than previously estimated. Because this revised optimal temperature (25°C) is much closer to current temperature conditions across much of Africa, future warming may reduce transmission suitability in regions where transmission is currently high. Still, temperatures across large parts of the continent will become more suitable for transmission overall under future climate scenarios, and the areas where low temperature completely prevents malaria transmission will contract. These contrasting patterns arise from the unimodal relationship between malaria transmission and temperature.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our map shows that most of Africa now has temperatures suitable for malaria transmission to some degree throughout the year. In fact, some regions are already beyond the thermal optimum for transmission, particularly just south of the Sahara (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Figs. 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">2b</a>). Suitability also varies seasonally (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>)—in March through June, the total most suitable area (top quantile) is smaller (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>, inset) because it is too hot in the north (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>, red color in maps) and too cold in the south (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>, blue color in maps). By contrast, much of the continent is most suitable from November through February. Furthermore, the new maps capture the current observed transmission in cooler regions where malaria is an ongoing concern, such as the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa (Kleinschmidt et al. 
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">2001</a>, Barnes et al. 
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">2005</a>). A map based on previous linear thermal responses predicted that most regions of Africa are currently cooler than optimum for transmission, with transmissibility peaking in April ( 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Fig. S1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By incorporating empirical findings that malaria transmission is optimal under moderate temperatures, and transmission potential declines at hot temperatures, our model generates nuanced predictions of current and future temperature suitability. For example, although the model predicts a small increase in the amount of geographic area with temperature suitable for any transmission by 2080, it also predicts a reduction in the area with temperature most suitable for transmission. Areas predicted to become newly suitable for transmission could face challenges to vector control and health infrastructure to mitigate increased transmission risk. Moreover, some of these predicted areas also coincide with centers of high population density, such as Western Uganda, suggesting large predicted geographic shifts in the number of people living where conditions are most suitable for transmission Africa.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our seasonal duration model of the most suitable transmission quantile was visually similar to the MARA map (MARA/ARMA, 
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">1999</a>). In contrast, our 100% range map of suitability predicts a much larger area of 12-month suitability, because it captures all areas where malaria transmission is not excluded for a full 12 months. Our map predictions differ from the MARA map in several regions, specifically in the Horn of Africa and in southern Africa; we find suitability where it is not predicted by MARA. These differences almost certainly reflect factors other than temperature, including different assumptions about humidity. In the MARA model specifications, full suitability in southern Africa (
  <span class="italic">i.e</span>., south of 8° latitude) was only achieved if an area experienced temperatures above 6°C and 80 mm or more of rain for at least 5 months (Guerra 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">2007</a>), a strict multivariate limit. This limit is used to focus MARA maps on endemic malaria areas, which is only a subset of what we considered.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other recent maps that focus specifically on areas in Africa suitable for epidemic (episodic) malaria (Grover-Kopec et al. 
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">2005</a>) match well with our predicted areas of lower transmission (lower suitability, short season). Our current predictions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2a</a>) correspond broadly with current 
  <span class="italic">P. falciparum</span> parasite prevalence measured in children ages 2–10 (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a> in Noor et al. 
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">2014</a>). A temperature-only suitability map based only on the duration of sporogony for 
  <span class="italic">P. falciparum</span>, developed by Guerra (
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">2007</a>) as a step in a larger modeling process indicates that all of Africa could potentially be suitable for the malaria parasite (see Fig. 6.6 in Guerra 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">2007</a>), in line with our “marginally suitable” or largest range limit. Our model also broadly corroborates predictions of current and future 
  <span class="italic">A. gambiae</span> range in Africa using an ecological niche model (Peterson 
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2009</a>). Because each malaria or vector mapping project discussed used slightly different criteria, we cannot expect these maps to correspond exactly. Other approaches, such as those that rely on empirical transmission data, could inadequately capture conditions that influence transmission in areas with human populations that are too small to sustain malaria or where data collection effort is too low to capture intermittent transmission. The challenges in understanding why each approach results in different predicted patterns highlight the need to make the mapping process more transparent across studies so they can be compared more directly (Johnson et al. 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our maps suggest that projected climate change could lead to a large decrease in the population at highest risk for malaria transmission. Future shifts in population density will affect the distribution of people living where temperatures are suitable for malaria transmission, and this distribution might also respond directly to changes in climate or malaria transmission. However, we emphasize that the Mordecai et al. (
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">2013</a>) model predicts that optimum transmission temperatures are cooler than in previous models. Given the predicted geographic shifts of these moderate temperatures, it is likely that the optimal transmission temperature and high population density will continue to coincide. Finally, our predicted transmission suitability under climate change is limited to the predictive quality of the climate model we use; understanding the importance of assumptions underlying climate change scenarios would require repeating the analyses described here under different climate regimes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We still need a better understanding of the behavior and physiology of local mosquito and parasite populations and their climate space. One thermal performance curve cannot capture the full breadth of thermal response behavior of all mosquito and parasite populations across Africa. Ectothermic populations differ in their responses to temperature within species, due to adaptation of local populations to prevailing local conditions (Angilletta et al. 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2002</a>), which may affect their capability to cope with climatic change (Sternberg and Thomas 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">2014</a>). Moreover, the actual temperatures that vectors and parasites experience can differ considerably from standard weather station data (Cator et al. 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">2013</a>), in part because mosquitoes can thermoregulate behaviorally (Blanford et al. 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2009</a>) and avoid extreme temperatures (Kirby and Lindsay 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">2004</a>). Temperature variation (
  <span class="italic">e.g</span>., daily temperature variation) may also be important for making more accurate local predictions, but we do not expect it to affect our general predictions for relative suitability. While daily fluctuations have been shown to affect mosquito and parasite development (Paaijmans et al. 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">2010</a>), this occurs mostly at the tails (upper and lower boundaries) of the range. Blanford et al. (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2013</a>) found that these temperature variations averaged over a month performed just as well as daily fluctuations for estimating biological rates. Nonetheless, local studies on mosquito physiology and behavior, combined with microclimatic measurements, will allow us to determine how climate, climate variability, and climate extremes eventually affect disease transmission at a finer scale (Altizer et al. 
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our approach focuses on determining how temperature impacts broad geographic patterns of malaria transmission potential. Spatial regression models incorporating many other environmental and socioeconomic covariates, such as atmospheric humidity, rainfall, or bed-net availability, could further enhance predictions at a local scale. Our model assesses the direct influence of temperature on transmission mechanistically. Thus, our results complement statistical models derived from field data to inform why malaria is excluded in some regions and highly prevalent in others. It can also serve as a baseline for predicting future suitability, as mechanistic models are useful for predicting outside the range of current data than traditional regression-based approaches (Rogers and Randolph 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">2006</a>, Bayarri et al. 
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">2009</a>). This framework allows us to disentangle the effects of other important factors, such as land use and disease control efforts (Gething et al. 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">2010</a>), to better predict transmission risk in the field.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We note that the timescale at which climate change may affect the distribution of suitability does not necessarily match that of health intervention planning. However, this suitability map can inform current allocation of intervention under current climate conditions by highlighting areas that perhaps were not previously identified as seasonally suitable or by distinguishing endemic suitability and epidemic suitability. Given that the types of intervention and control differ in these contrasting scenarios, and that resistance can emerge in more episodic areas, we think this map is of value to planning. Most importantly, with accurate suitability predictions and appropriate planning for potential geographic shifts in risk, an increase in transmission suitability does not have to increase malaria cases.</p>
