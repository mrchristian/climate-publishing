 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the population at risk for transmission, we used population projection data for 2015 from the Gridded Populations of the World (GPW) version 3.0 (CIESIN, 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">2005</a>), and the Global Rural Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) Urban extents layer (CIESIN, 
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">2011</a>). We resampled the projected malaria model and urban extents to the GPW resolution (2.5 arcmin) using bilinear interpolation. To visualize the impact of malaria shift and population density, we first scaled malaria season duration (0–12 months) to a 0–1 scale and log-transformed population density for ease of visualization. Malaria transmission ceases to be a function of the environment in high-density urban areas (Gething et al. 
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">2011</a>), so we excluded these from our analysis with the GRUMP data by simply masking out the areas described as urban extents.
