 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species respond to rising temperatures in numerous ways. For example, some shift the elevation or latitude of their range (Thomas 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0058">2010</a>; Chen et al. 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0013">2011</a>). However, before shifting geographically, individuals attempt to tolerate novel environmental conditions and maintain their mass/energy balance through behavioral thermoregulation (Huey et al. 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0023">2012</a>). These earliest responses to environmental change may not initially reduce body condition below thresholds where individual survival or fecundity is impacted. However, as environmental conditions deviate further from the range of conditions to which organisms are ecologically adapted, individuals may be forced to make behavioral trade‐offs to maintain energy balance (Speakman and Król 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0056">2010</a>). Ultimately, these behavioral changes may impact individual fecundity (Parker et al. 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0042">2009</a>), which, on relatively short timescales, may lead to population‐level effects such as range shifts, local extirpations, and ultimately extinction (e.g., Sinervo et al. 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0051">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand and predict the earliest behavioral responses to climate change, we must consider the biophysical mechanisms that limit the activity of organisms. Optimality theory states that organisms evolve to make behavioral decisions so as to maximize their fitness, and these decisions are informed by environmental cues that may have historically limited fitness (Westneat and Fox 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0060">2010</a>). For example, at the height of a temperate growing season, organisms may limit foraging time when temperatures are high, and instead rest or take refuge in cooler microclimates. Although foraging confers essential fitness benefits through the improvement or maintenance of body condition, resting or taking refuge when temperatures are high may confer even greater fitness benefits by reducing heat gain and avoiding hyperthermia (Ricklefs and Miller 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0047">2000</a>). These critical decisions are fundamentally governed by the biophysical parameters of organisms (i.e., metabolic rate, surface properties) in combination with the external environmental conditions (i.e., landscape, microclimate) in which the organism resides, which together comprise the underpinning features of biophysical animal models. Biophysical models may prove useful in predicting how different animal populations are affected by climate and how they may respond; essential information for management and recovery of imperiled species. For example, biophysical models may allow us to better prioritize conservation efforts by identifying species with the least ability to tolerate rising temperatures through behavioral thermoregulation and also species whose fundamental and realized niches may move beyond the borders of current protected areas (Monzon et al. 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0038">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For many such species presumed and demonstrated to be at risk from climate change, considerable gaps in our understanding exist concerning the driving biological mechanisms, because fine‐scale data on the physiological effects of the thermal environment are rarely available (Beever and Belant 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0004">2011</a>). Biophysical models therefore hold enormous potential for complementing traditional correlative approaches to fill gaps in knowledge for species of conservation concern. For the American pika (
  <span class="italic">Ochotona princeps,</span> Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31848-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31848-fig-0001">1</a>), a temperature‐sensitive mammal inhabiting mountainous regions of the western Unites States (Smith and Weston 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0055">1990</a>), such knowledge gaps were cited in a recent rejection of a petition to list the species as threatened by climate change under the Endangered Species Act (Crist 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0015">2010</a>). In particular, more data are needed concerning pikas' abilities to tolerate high ambient temperatures through behavioral thermoregulation. This need, along with its known temperature sensitivity, makes the pika an ideal model organism for investigating temperature‐driven behavior modification from a biophysical perspective.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pika basal metabolic rate (BMR) is high (143% of predicted weight‐specific value) and thermal conductance is low (101–53% of predicted values; MacArthur and Wang 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0030">1973</a>), resulting in elevated and stable body temperatures (mean = 40.1°C) and relatively low upper‐lethal temperatures (mean = 43.1°C; Smith 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0052">1974</a>). These factors suggest that behavior plays an important role in pika thermoregulation (MacArthur and Wang 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0031">1974</a>). Indeed, hyperthermia and death may occur at moderate (25.5–29.4°C) ambient temperatures (MacArthur and Wang 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0030">1973</a>; Smith 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0052">1974</a>). These physiological sensitivities scale up to drive biogeographic distributional patterns in pikas; at high latitudes, 
  <span class="italic">O. princeps</span> is found at elevations ranging from sea level to 4000 m, but pikas are rarely found below 2500 m where they meet their southern range boundary (Smith and Weston 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0055">1990</a>). At these scales, pikas have responded to changes in climate both recently and historically by shifting upslope or becoming extirpated at low‐elevation sites across their range, suggesting vulnerability to rapid climate change in the 21st century (Hafner 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0020">1993</a>; Grayson

  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0061">2011</a>). However, pika declines are not range‐wide (e.g., Millar and Westfall 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0036">2010</a>; Erb et al. 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0017">2011</a>; Smith and Nagy 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0054">2015</a>) and they persist at relatively warm and low‐elevation sites, especially where cooler and wetter microclimates exist (e.g., Beever 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0003">2002</a>; Beever et al.

  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0059">2014</a>). The mechanisms driving pika range shifts and extirpations in certain subpopulations but not others remain unclear, primarily because we do not know enough about their biophysical tolerances and capacity to behaviorally thermoregulate.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We present an analysis of environmental drivers of pika activity using a multifaceted approach that includes both the use of biophysical modeling and direct observations of pika activity. To do this, we (1) used temperature and microclimate data from the pika's thermal environment coupled with fur properties, body size, and wind speed to build a biophysical model (Niche Mapper, Porter and Mitchell 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0044">2006</a>) that could predict metabolic rate and activity hours of the American pika. We subsequently tested the biophysical model by simulating empirical metabolic chamber data. Next, we (2) performed statistical analyses using 288 h of field observations of pika activity from a series of field sites in Glacier National Park (GNP), Montana, USA, to understand how environmental variables were associated with pika activity in the field. We also predicted the available activity time at a series of field sites using our biophysical model and qualitatively compared predicted values to observed pika activity at those sites. Finally, (3) we used the biophysical model to predict how pikas may be forced to respond behaviorally to projected 21st century climate change.
