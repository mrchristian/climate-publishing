 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Niche Mapper is described in detail elsewhere (Porter and Mitchell 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0044">2006</a>; Mathewson and Porter 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0032">2013</a>). In brief, Niche Mapper consists of two submodels: a microclimate model and an endotherm model. The microclimate model computes the hourly values of local air temperature at animal height, ground surface temperatures, below ground soil temperatures, local wind speed and relative humidity, and direct and diffuse solar radiation in the sun and shade. The endotherm model numerically solves for metabolic rates that allow an animal to maintain its core temperature within a defined range under the computed environmental conditions. To do so, both models solve the generic heat balance model,

  <span class="italic"> + Q</span>
  <sub>gen</sub>
  <span class="italic"> = Q</span>
  <sub>out </sub>
  <span class="italic">+ Q</span>
  <sub>st</sub>; where heat in (
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>in</sub>) comes from solar and infrared radiation; 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>gen</sub> is metabolic heat generated (set to zero for the microclimate model); heat out (
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>out</sub>), is infrared radiation from the surface (ground or fur–air interface), convective heat loss, and evaporative heat loss; and stored heat (
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>st</sub>), which is set to zero in the endotherm model for steady‐state simulations. Niche Mapper solves these equations for each hour of the day, enabling analyses such as how many hours of a month's “average” day a model animal will be either heat or cold stressed when trying to maintain a given activity level (quantified as a multiple of BMR). If the metabolic rate that solves the heat balance equation is below the target activity level, the animal is predicted to overheat if active in those conditions and thus activity is not possible.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested Niche Mapper's ability to predict metabolic rates as a function of ambient air temperature prior to field simulations of pikas in GNP by simulating the metabolic chamber experiments of MacArthur and Wang (
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0030">1973</a>), using the same mean pika mass (109 g) and constant wind speed (0.1 m/s) used in the experiments. We also conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to determine the influence of various animal and environmental properties on the model's metabolic rate predictions.
