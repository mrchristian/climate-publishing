  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed altitudinal lapse rate varied depending on the prevailing daily weather patterns and time of day. Temperature inversions were more frequent during mornings (07:00) and in September (see Tables S5–7). We measured a consistent lapse rate (
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2 </span>&gt; 0.75) during seven of 24 measurements, for which the mean lapse rate was −9.46°C/km. The midday (14:00) mean for July and August measurements was −8.08°C/km.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference between below‐ and above‐talus temperature varied considerably depending on the time of day, and generally below‐talus temperatures were less variable than above‐talus temperatures. In the mornings (05:15–08:15), temperatures below the talus were slightly warmer than above‐talus conditions, with higher minimum (mean°C below talus – mean°C above talus [standard deviation]: +2.50°C [1.69°C]), and maximum temperatures (+2.62°C [1.69°C]). During the warmest part of the day (13:00–16:00), the temperature‐damping effects of the below‐talus thermal refuge were most pronounced, exhibiting substantially lower minimum (−13.08°C [2.42°C]) and maximum temperatures (−15.44°C [1.94°C]). The evenings (19:00–21:00) produced higher minimum temperatures below‐talus (+2.75°C [1.95°C]), but lower maximums (−3.75°C [1.78°C]).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sensitivity analyses of Niche Mapper's microclimate model revealed sufficient stability in response to input variability within ranges expected in the field, consistent with previous tests (Kearney et al. 
   <a rid="ece31848-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0027">2014a</a>,
   <a rid="ece31848-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0028">b</a>). Varying the specific heat of the talus by up to 30% (700–1000 J/kg K) produced a maximum 12% change in modeled surface temperatures and 10% change in temperatures 15 cm below the surface. Increasing wind speed from 0.1 to 1.5 m/sec decreased modeled temperatures at animal height (9 cm) by a maximum of 15%; further increases from 1.5 to 9 m/sec produced at most a 10% temperature decrease. Modifying cloud cover from 0 to 100% and aspect from south to north produced a maximum 9% and 2.5% decrease in temperature at animal height, respectively. The remaining inputs produced &lt;2% changes in modeled temperature when varied within expected ranges.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The microclimate model also produced relatively robust estimates of above‐ and below‐talus temperatures when compared to field measurements (see Figs. S2–S5). Surface temperature estimates most closely matched observed when a −8°C/km altitudinal lapse rate was used to estimate air temperature and when wind speed was allowed to vary diurnally from 0 to 4 m/sec. Below‐talus temperature estimates fit field measurements closest using a modeled depth of 20 cm for the 1056 m site and 15 cm for the 2521 m site. The microclimate model assumed a solid below‐surface substrate (in contrast to porous talus deposits); thus, simulated depths were 100–200% less than the size of the rocks under which the loggers were placed.</p>
