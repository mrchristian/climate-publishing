 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Niche Mapper's activity level predictions were similar to observations at field sites in GNP. Predicted activity levels, quantified by the ratio of maximum allowable FMR to BMR, were lowest when temperatures were high and increased as temperatures dropped. Above 20°C, modeled 150 g pikas began physiologically thermoregulating (vasodilation, raising body temperature) in order to maintain a target metabolic rate of 1.5 ×  their BMR, which corresponds to the minimum value necessary for activity (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31848-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31848-fig-0004">4</a>A). Additionally, increasing predicted allowable activity levels corresponded to the highest rates and variance of observed per capita pika activity (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31848-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31848-fig-0005">5</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using 1.5 FMR/BMR as the minimum metabolic ratio for activity, a simulated 120 g pika in GNP was able to remain active above the talus during all available diurnal hours of the day (June and July = 21, August = 19 h), regardless of elevation or pelage (summer vs. winter). However, a 150 g pika with winter pelage faced physiological limitations that reduced allowable activity time by 19.0% in July at 1500 m, 4.8% in July at 1750 m, and 15.8% in August at 1500 m.</p>
