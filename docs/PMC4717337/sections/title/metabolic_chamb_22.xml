 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We demonstrated that Niche Mapper accurately predicted pika metabolic rates from metabolic chamber experiments across a wide range of temperatures (Fig.Â 
  <a rid="ece31848-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31848-fig-0002">2</a>). Sensitivity analyses revealed that fur properties, animal size, and ambient wind speed had relatively large physiological, and thus behavioral, consequences. These factors are rarely considered in studies of pika behavior and occurrence, but our work suggests that they may play a critical role in pika persistence in a warming climate.
