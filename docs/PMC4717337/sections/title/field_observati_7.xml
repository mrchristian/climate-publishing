 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed pika activity at eight sites in GNP from 15 to 24 July, 2009. We chose sites that had relatively high pika densities across a broad range of elevations and slope aspects. We conducted twelve separate 3‐h observations per site during the following intervals: morning (05:15–08:15), midday (13:00–16:00), and evening (19:00–22:00). We conducted observations over a 10‐day span to reduce the effect of seasonality; pikas are more active in late summer when caching food (Smith and Weston 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0055">1990</a>). Morning observations commenced ~45 min prior to sunrise and evening observations concluded ~30 min after sunset. We observed pika activity passively from a high vantage point, because pikas pay little attention to quiet observers (Conner 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0014">1983</a>). Trained observers continuously scanned the talus using the naked eye or 7 × 35 binoculars, and recorded the time of all visual and audible evidence of pika activity. Observers worked in pairs, but recorded data from nonoverlapping areas (~40 m radius) of the same talus patch, assigning pikas temporary ID numbers and sketching maps of their whereabouts to distinguish the activity of individuals (sensu Barash 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0002">1973</a>). A single pika call or sighting was considered a “unique event”. Additional calls or sightings of the same individual within 30 sec were recorded, but not considered new unique events. In this way, we categorized brief flourishes of activity as single events. We identified the type of observed behavior under the following nonmutually exclusive categories: haying (collecting or carrying vegetation in the mouth), foraging (directly consuming vegetation), moving fast, moving slow, and vigilant (stationary). We assumed that imperfect detection of pikas played a relatively small role in data collection, because pikas are highly detectable (85–95%) and relatively easy to identify for a stationary observer (Beever et al.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used multiple regression to associate minimum above‐talus temperature (
  <span class="italic">t</span>) and two site‐level variables (elevation, 
  <span class="italic">e</span>; slope aspect, 
  <span class="italic">a</span>) with aggregate above‐talus pika activity observations to understand whether field observations were generally congruent with predictions from our biophysical model. We only modeled pika activity with minimum above‐talus temperature because of moderate to high collinearity with other temperature measurements (0.55 &lt; 
  <span class="italic">r </span>&lt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.99) and because minimum above‐talus temperature best explained variability in pika activity in preliminary analysis (see Table S2). There was no strong collinearity detected among the remaining predictor variables (
  <span class="italic">r </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.06–0.26). We developed a set of 10 a priori hypotheses relating minimum above‐talus temperature, elevation, and slope aspect to observed pika activity (see Table S3) and evaluated relative empirical support for these hypotheses using AIC
  <sub>C</sub> (Burnham and Anderson 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0012">2002</a>). We derived parameter estimates that accounted for model selection uncertainty by performing model averaging among models with &gt;10% AIC weight and without uninformative parameters (Burnham and Anderson 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0012">2002</a>; Arnold 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0001">2010</a>). We log‐transformed the response variable (per capita pika sightings) to approximate a normal distribution (Ives 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0025">2015</a>). Log‐linear forms of 
  <span class="italic">e</span>,
  <span class="italic"> a</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">t</span> outperformed linear and quadratic forms in preliminary analysis (see Fig. S1); therefore, we used log‐linear forms of our predictor variables in the final analysis. We fit models and performed model selection using the package ‘AICcmodavg’ (Mazerolle
