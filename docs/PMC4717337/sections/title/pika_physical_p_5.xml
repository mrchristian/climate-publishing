 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pika physical properties used for biophysical modeling (see below) were either measured directly using a preserved pika specimen from the University of Wisconsin‐Madison Zoology Museum (with summer pelage, obtained in Colorado) or gleaned from the literature. We directly measured fur length and reflectivity for dorsal and ventral sections of the torso and legs. We assumed that winter fur was 50% longer than summer fur (Howell 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0022">1924</a>), and that fur depth was always 50% of fur length. Animal model inputs are summarized in Table S1 of the Supporting Information.
