  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of ambient temperature on metabolic rate was most heavily influenced by the core temperature, body posture, size, and fur properties of the modeled pika. Increasing core temperature from 38 to 43°C produced 8–25% higher metabolic demands (W/g), depending on ambient temperature. Changing posture from a 3:2 to 3:1 ellipsoid produced ~10% higher metabolic demands in a 150 g pika at temperatures ranging from −15 to 30°C. At cooler temperatures, pikas with lower mass (e.g., 109 g), and thus smaller volume, were at an energetic disadvantage because they were required to generate proportionally more metabolic heat to maintain core temperatures. However, above 22°C, smaller pikas had an energetic advantage in that they were able to avoid overheating at higher temperatures. Additionally, summer fur allowed pikas of all sizes to stay in their thermal neutral zone at temperatures 4°C higher than those with winter fur (see Fig. S6). Increasing fur density from 250 to 3000 hairs/cm
   <span class="sup">2</span> produced 61% lower metabolic rates at 0°C; further increases from 3000 to 15,000 hairs/cm
   <span class="sup">2</span> produced 15% lower rates. Increasing O
   <sub>2</sub> extraction efficiency from 5 to 30% produced up to 6% lower metabolic rates, while increasing flesh thermal conductivity from 0.5 to 2.8 (W/mK) increased metabolic rates by up to 13%. Finally, when we modeled a constant solar input of 500 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> directly overhead, increasing pelt reflectivity from 15 to 90% produced 15% higher metabolic rates.
