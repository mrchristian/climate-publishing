   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed altitudinal lapse rate varied depending on the prevailing daily weather patterns and time of day. Temperature inversions were more frequent during mornings (07:00) and in September (see Tables S5–7). We measured a consistent lapse rate (
    <span class="italic">R</span>
    <span class="sup">2 </span>&gt; 0.75) during seven of 24 measurements, for which the mean lapse rate was −9.46°C/km. The midday (14:00) mean for July and August measurements was −8.08°C/km.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference between below‐ and above‐talus temperature varied considerably depending on the time of day, and generally below‐talus temperatures were less variable than above‐talus temperatures. In the mornings (05:15–08:15), temperatures below the talus were slightly warmer than above‐talus conditions, with higher minimum (mean°C below talus – mean°C above talus [standard deviation]: +2.50°C [1.69°C]), and maximum temperatures (+2.62°C [1.69°C]). During the warmest part of the day (13:00–16:00), the temperature‐damping effects of the below‐talus thermal refuge were most pronounced, exhibiting substantially lower minimum (−13.08°C [2.42°C]) and maximum temperatures (−15.44°C [1.94°C]). The evenings (19:00–21:00) produced higher minimum temperatures below‐talus (+2.75°C [1.95°C]), but lower maximums (−3.75°C [1.78°C]).</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sensitivity analyses of Niche Mapper's microclimate model revealed sufficient stability in response to input variability within ranges expected in the field, consistent with previous tests (Kearney et al. 
    <a rid="ece31848-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0027">2014a</a>,
    <a rid="ece31848-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0028">b</a>). Varying the specific heat of the talus by up to 30% (700–1000 J/kg K) produced a maximum 12% change in modeled surface temperatures and 10% change in temperatures 15 cm below the surface. Increasing wind speed from 0.1 to 1.5 m/sec decreased modeled temperatures at animal height (9 cm) by a maximum of 15%; further increases from 1.5 to 9 m/sec produced at most a 10% temperature decrease. Modifying cloud cover from 0 to 100% and aspect from south to north produced a maximum 9% and 2.5% decrease in temperature at animal height, respectively. The remaining inputs produced &lt;2% changes in modeled temperature when varied within expected ranges.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The microclimate model also produced relatively robust estimates of above‐ and below‐talus temperatures when compared to field measurements (see Figs. S2–S5). Surface temperature estimates most closely matched observed when a −8°C/km altitudinal lapse rate was used to estimate air temperature and when wind speed was allowed to vary diurnally from 0 to 4 m/sec. Below‐talus temperature estimates fit field measurements closest using a modeled depth of 20 cm for the 1056 m site and 15 cm for the 2521 m site. The microclimate model assumed a solid below‐surface substrate (in contrast to porous talus deposits); thus, simulated depths were 100–200% less than the size of the rocks under which the loggers were placed.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of ambient temperature on metabolic rate was most heavily influenced by the core temperature, body posture, size, and fur properties of the modeled pika. Increasing core temperature from 38 to 43°C produced 8–25% higher metabolic demands (W/g), depending on ambient temperature. Changing posture from a 3:2 to 3:1 ellipsoid produced ~10% higher metabolic demands in a 150 g pika at temperatures ranging from −15 to 30°C. At cooler temperatures, pikas with lower mass (e.g., 109 g), and thus smaller volume, were at an energetic disadvantage because they were required to generate proportionally more metabolic heat to maintain core temperatures. However, above 22°C, smaller pikas had an energetic advantage in that they were able to avoid overheating at higher temperatures. Additionally, summer fur allowed pikas of all sizes to stay in their thermal neutral zone at temperatures 4°C higher than those with winter fur (see Fig. S6). Increasing fur density from 250 to 3000 hairs/cm
    <span class="sup">2</span> produced 61% lower metabolic rates at 0°C; further increases from 3000 to 15,000 hairs/cm
    <span class="sup">2</span> produced 15% lower rates. Increasing O
    <sub>2</sub> extraction efficiency from 5 to 30% produced up to 6% lower metabolic rates, while increasing flesh thermal conductivity from 0.5 to 2.8 (W/mK) increased metabolic rates by up to 13%. Finally, when we modeled a constant solar input of 500 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span> directly overhead, increasing pelt reflectivity from 15 to 90% produced 15% higher metabolic rates.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With winter fur, potential activity time for a 150 g pika declined under the future warming scenario at elevations below 2500 m. In June, when many pikas may still have winter fur, allowable activity time declined by 23.8% and 4.8% at 1500 m and 1750 m, respectively. Further investigation of the impacts of interactions between body size and fur properties on allowable activity for a pika at low elevation (1500 m) in GNP in year 2100 revealed no activity restrictions for a 120 g pika with 30% shorter and shallower fur (compared to the measured specimen), but 37% fewer activity hours for a 180 g pika with 20% longer and thicker fur (Fig.
