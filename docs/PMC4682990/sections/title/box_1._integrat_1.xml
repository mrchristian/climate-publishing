 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mesocosms have a central role to play in predicting the impact of climate on different ecological levels, ranging from individual species to whole communities (and potentially to entire ecosystems). At the species level, they enable the effect of global warming on demographic traits (fecundity, mortality, density dependent population growth rate, etc.) to be directly estimated. This information can be integrated into population models to determine risk of extinction in the absence of immigration and emigration (

  <a rid="pbio.1002323.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002323.ref014">14</a>]. Data on species’ physiological tolerance from mesocosm experiments can also be coupled with spatial geographic information system (GIS) layers of present-day and likely future climatic conditions to predict the potential range of a species [
  <a rid="pbio.1002323.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002323.ref015">15</a>]. Using this information in metapopulation models to define dynamic patch structures improves estimates of extinction risk from climate change, by accounting for important spatial and demographic processes and their interaction [
  <a rid="pbio.1002323.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002323.ref016">16</a>]. If natal dispersal is not estimated in the mesocosm experiment, field-based or allometric estimates can be used in the metapopulation model. Mesocosm experiments can also be used to directly improve our understanding of key principles of population ecology, including the importance of plasticity in life history traits and predator–prey dynamics on persistence (
  <a rid="pbio.1002323.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pbio.1002323.g001">Fig 1</a>). Furthermore, metapopulation and demographic models, coupled to mesocosm experimental data, can be used to test and improve theoretical expectations. Together this will lead to better forecasts of extinction risk and range dynamics [
  <a rid="pbio.1002323.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002323.ref017">17</a>], especially if the sensitivity of evolutionary adaptation to environmental and demographic conditions can be quantified and incorporated in models of population persistence [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the community level, mesocosms provide an important opportunity to explore and disentangle mechanisms of community assembly and, thus, better establish how climate shifts are likely to affect biodiversity, community structure, and the ecosystem processes that they maintain. Mesocosms can be used to quantify the effect of global warming on species composition and turnover, the strength of biotic interactions, and the distribution of functional traits (e.g., body size), among other ecological processes. This information can be used to parameterize models of local (α) and regional (ϒ) diversity (
  <a rid="pbio.1002323.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pbio.1002323.g001">Fig 1</a>). For example, metacommunity models can potentially be used to explore the likely influence of climate change on connected local community assemblages (i.e., communities linked by dispersal and multiple interacting species) and to improve key theoretical paradigms on how spatial dynamics and local interactions shape community structure [
  <a rid="pbio.1002323.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002323.ref019">19</a>]. Furthermore, estimates of ecological mechanisms driving temperature-related shifts in species assemblages can be used to test key theories underpinning spatial community ecology, such as temperature-driven body-size reduction at the community level [
  <a rid="pbio.1002323.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002323.ref020">20</a>], the effect of trophic interaction strengths on food-web structure, and the role of community composition on stability and persistence [
  <a rid="pbio.1002323.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002323.ref007">7</a>]. Together this will improve forecasts of biodiversity loss and provide crucial information on how to maintain ecosystem processes and services in the face of species loss (
  <a rid="pbio.1002323.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pbio.1002323.g001">Fig 1</a>). Forecasts and theoretical evidence of ecological responses to climate change will be strongest if mesocosms account for a wide range of future climate change scenarios (including variation in extreme events) [
  <a rid="pbio.1002323.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002323.ref013">13</a>] and potential synergies of drivers of global change (e.g., habitat fragmentation and exploitation) [
