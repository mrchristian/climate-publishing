 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we developed a simple and practical G&amp;Y model that can predict individual-tree BA increment and volume increment over 5-year intervals. The model is based on ANNs and has the capability to predict growth under current climate conditions as well as under three projected climate-change scenarios. The G&amp;Y model was formulated and validated against over 40 years of tree data from 3250 PSPs, together with 90 years of data for projected future climates. The model predicted individual-tree growth in multi-species forest for both even-aged and uneven-aged stands. The model requires traditional forest inventory attributes, in addition to incident solar radiation, GDDs, and indices of soil nutrient and soil water content at the location of PSPs as primary input. This study demonstrated a novel modelling approach to integrate climate change impacts in forest G&amp;Y models. The study also demonstrated the virtue of using artificial intelligence in modelling forest G&amp;Y.</p>
