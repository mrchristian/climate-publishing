 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change has become an important issue of the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century. Based on many years of study, the scientific community has concluded that changes in global climate are mainly caused by increases in anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref001">1</a>]. Evidence from many sources indicates that climate change is getting stronger and this upward trend is expected to amplify into the future [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref002">2</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref003">3</a>]. Global climate models (GCMs) predict that there will be significant change in climate by the end of the current century. For the Maritime Provinces of eastern Canada, GCMs predict a 2–4°C temperature increase during summer and a 1.5–6°C increase in winter [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climatic factors have a direct impact on tree growth and overall forest productivity, as well as indirect impacts on forest ecosystem functioning [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref006">6</a>]. Climate change will modify tree-growing environments by altering site conditions, such as soil water content, atmospheric humidity, soil and air temperatures, and the length of growing seasons. The forest industry is expected to be the most affected by climate change, compared to other resource-based industries. This is because normal harvesting rotations for timber range from 50 to 100 years for most tree species and present-day forests are expected to experience a period of transition from current to future growing conditions over the next 100 years. Forests provide important socio-economic and ecological services, and existing forests cannot be replaced quickly over the short term to accommodate the anticipated changes in tree-growing environment. Therefore, existing forests need to be managed during this period of transition with well-informed management plans that account for the effects of climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quality of forest management plans hinges on the quality and reliability of growth and yield (G &amp; Y) predictions. Traditionally, G&amp;Y models are developed from large amounts of historical data using statistical techniques [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref008">8</a>]. These models usually require simple inputs and predict with relatively low bias at regional scales [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref009">9</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref010">10</a>]. Growth models are available for even-aged and uneven-aged stands as well as single and mixed species forests. These models have the capability to produce information from individual-tree to stand and forest levels. However, these models are empirical in nature and as a result are applicable only to stand growing conditions similar to the conditions for which they were developed [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref010">10</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref011">11</a>]. Also, these empirical models rely on a core assumption that climatic and environmental conditions significant to tree growth are not violated [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref010">10</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref013">13</a>]. It has been realised by scientists that G&amp;Y predictions using traditional empirical models could be biased under a changing climatic regime [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref014">14</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref017">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Process-based models are widely used to investigate forest response to climatic change because they predict tree growth based on biological cause-and-effect associations [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref014">14</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref018">18</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref019">19</a>]. Gap models are a special type of process-based forest ecosystem models that can take into account climatic and environmental influences based on eco-physiological principles [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref020">20</a>]. Gap models are valuable tools to study tree growth, species composition, and stand-structure dynamics under diverse climatic conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref021">21</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref022">22</a>]. Considerable attempts had been made to use gap models to evaluate climate change impacts on forests [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref023">23</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref029">29</a>]. However, gap models have rarely been used in conventional forest management planning due to their intensive data requirements, model structure complexity, and incompatibility with management needs to produce G&amp;Y information [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref030">30</a>]. Process-based models do not have the same accuracy at regional scales compared to conventional models (empirical), because they are not developed to account for site differences across regions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is an urgent need for practical and simple G&amp;Y models, easily operated by forest managers, and yet sophisticated enough to predict future forest dynamics under a changing climate. The preferred models should be based on empirical data, but should not be as complicated as process-based models. The objective of this study was to develop a simple G&amp;Y model that (1) utilises conventional tree- and stand-growth attributes, and (2) has the capability to predict individual-tree growth under different climate-change scenarios. The new model was developed by combining tree growth information generated with a process-based model and historical data acquired from permanent sample plots (PSPs).</p>
