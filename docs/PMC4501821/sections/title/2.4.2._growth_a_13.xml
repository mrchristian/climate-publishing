 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Input data required to predict future forest states with JABOWA-3 includes (i) climatic information, (ii) initial stand conditions, and (iii) site conditions, including soil information. Projected future climate data (climate change) were acquired from Environment Canada [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref039">39</a>]. The information related to site conditions was extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) and GIS thematic maps of NS, while soil-related information was acquired from the Canadian Soil Information Service (CANSIS) [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref040">40</a>]. Initial stand conditions were based on PSP records. Tree growth projections were developed for 34 PSP locations across NS, selected to represent nine eco-regions and capture the diverse climatic and site growing conditions of NS. The model was first calibrated using historical weather records and observed PSP data from NS [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref041">41</a>]. JABOWA-3 was initiated with existing stand conditions using relevant projected future climates. The model was run 5â€“7 times for each location to lessen the effect of model stochasticity inherent in model functions of mortality and ingrowth. Individual-tree diameter and height dynamics for the next 90 years were extracted from JABOWA-3 outputs under three projected climate-change scenarios.
