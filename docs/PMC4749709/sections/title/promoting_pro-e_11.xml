 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following on from the point above, there is strong evidence that people are more likely to act in environmentally friendly ways when the norms of a behaviorally relevant ingroup—especially one that people identify highly with—are supportive of pro-environmental action. It may not always be possible to make salient a social identity with supportive environmental norms and, as we noted previously, it is often the case that ingroups have positive environmental injunctive norms but negative environmental descriptive norms (i.e., most group members support pro-environmental action but only a minority actually engage in it). Research has shown that placing a greater emphasis on the injunctive norm can help to overcome the problem of a negative descriptive norm (

  <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">Smith and Louis, 2008</a>). Thus, rather than drawing attention to the negative ingroup descriptive norms (e.g., only a minority of young people are engaging in actions to protect the environment) the focus needs to be on the positive injunctive norm (a majority of young people support actions that protect the environment).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If ingroup norms are not pro-environmental, another strategy supported by the social identity approach (and discussed above) is to make salient a higher order social category that does have pro-environmental norms. For example, data show that young adults engage in less pro-environmental behavior than older age groups (
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Eurobarometer, 2011</a>). Hence, making a higher order identity salient—for example, a national identity that encompasses more pro-environmental age groups—may help to reinforce pro-environmental norms and positively influence pro-environmental behavior as these norms and behavior can be truthfully attributed to the broader ingroup. This strategy may be more likely to be effective when the lower order category (e.g., young people) are represented as part of the broader social group (
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Hornsey and Hogg, 2000a</a>). For example, communication that reminds people that members of their country support pro-environmental policy and behavior could be accompanied by images that incorporate a range of citizens including younger citizens. Whether or not this approach could work in contexts where the subordinate identity is particularly salient, such as young people making environmental decisions in the presence of their peers, remains an empirical question.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To this point, we have described strategies that could help to shift perceptions of ingroup norms. A more direct approach is suggested by 
  <a rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78">Seyranian (2014)</a> and 
  <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">Seyranian et al. (2015)</a> who advance the concept of social identity framing as a way to shape the content of ingroup identity. This approach outlines a process whereby a leader can shift social identity content in a direction that can help to promote positive social change. They highlight the need for leaders to advance a vision to group members through the use of inclusive ingroup language (e.g., we, us). As an example, when ingroup leaders advocated for renewable energy using inclusive language, support for renewable energy was perceived to be more ingroup normative and there were greater intentions on the part of ingroup members to act in relation to renewable energy (
  <a rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78">Seyranian, 2014</a>). Further research is needed to identify the critical elements that are most effective at changing the content of ingroup identity.
