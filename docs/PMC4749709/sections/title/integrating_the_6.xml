 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A question raised by our analysis is whether the social identity approach adds to the understanding of environmental problems beyond other prominent theoretical frameworks. In this section, we examine the similarities and differences between the social identity approach and other relevant theories, with a view to highlighting possibilities for integration and stimulating future directions across frameworks.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most prominent theoretical lenses applied to understanding climate change beliefs is cultural cognition theory, which adapts the theorizing of 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Douglas and Wildavsky (1982)</a> on cultural influences and risk perceptions. The theory of cultural cognition (
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">Kahan, 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">Kahan et al., 2010</a>) draws on Douglas’s grid/group taxonomy – 
  <span class="italic">individualistic-communitarian</span> and 
  <span class="italic">hierarchical-egalitarian –</span> and argues that these cultural orientations shape people’s appraisal of risk, evidence, and scientific consensus. For example, people who subscribe to relatively individualistic and hierarchical values favor self-reliance, competition and free market solutions. In contrast, people who subscribe to relatively communitarian and egalitarian values are concerned with social injustice, are suspicious of authority (including industry) and are committed to cooperation. Hence, those high on individualism and hierarchy are more inclined to value industry, downplay its risk to the environment and oppose regulation. Research guided by this theoretical framework has shown empirical evidence of the influence of these cultural values. For example, judgments of expertise were influenced by the extent to which that expert’s position aligned with participants’ cultural values in relation to climate change, nuclear waste, and gun laws (
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">Kahan et al., 2011</a>). Specifically, when an expert presented climate change as a high risk, egalitarian communitarian participants were much more likely to agree that they were an expert than hierarchical individualist participants and vice versa, when the expert presented climate change as a low risk (see also 
  <a rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69">Price et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, a meta-analysis shows that ratings of hierarchicalism and individualism share robust and medium-sized relationships with people’s skepticism that anthropogenic climate change is real (
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">Hornsey et al., in press</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What the cultural cognition and social identity approach share is the notion that people filter information through a particular lens—either through the lens of worldviews (in the case of cultural cognition theory) or through the lens of social identity and its associated norms. Hence, both perspectives conclude that beliefs about climate change will depend on how climate change aligns with these important meaning-making psychological structures. Where the social identity approach departs from cultural cognition is in its focus on the context-dependent nature of identity. Worldviews and values are relatively static or at best slow to change whereas identity is fluid and may become more or less salient depending on the context. If we integrate across the two perspectives, cultural cognition theory suggests that people with individualistic and hierarchical values would be more likely to identify with conservative political parties. If they do so and the identity becomes salient, then the norms of that identity will guide responses to issues that are group-relevant, such as climate change policy. This integration suggests that identity may mediate between cultural worldviews and environmentally related attitudes and behavior.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One can also imagine, though, that some contexts may bring to the fore identities that would trump or at least attenuate cultural worldviews. For example, in a workplace where climate change policy is being supported and reinforced, social identity theory would predict that the work-place identity would be the most proximal influence on an individual’s climate-change attitudes and behaviors, at least for those individuals who identify with their organization. For those who are less identified, their worldviews may have a greater influence on their attitudes to the workplace climate change policies. Future research that integrates across these two theories could test these hypotheses.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within the environmental psychology literature there are two key theories that often frame research seeking to understand environmental decisions and behavior: the theory of planned behavior (TPB; 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Ajzen, 1991</a>) and value-belief-norm (VBN) theory (
  <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">Stern et al., 1999</a>; 
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">Stern, 2000</a>). The attraction of the TPB is that it is a parsimonious model—it proposes that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control predict intentions which in turn predict behavior. Another advantage of the model is that its simplicity allows other relevant variables to be integrated into the model thereby increasing its predictive power (
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">Conner and Armitage, 1998</a>). Social identity researchers have integrated social identity concepts into the TPB in two main ways: First, they have drawn on social identity theory to address the question of why subjective norms often emerge as the weakest predictor of intentions (
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">Armitage and Conner, 2001</a>). From a social identity perspective, it is not necessarily the norms of important others 
  <span class="italic">in general</span> that will predict environmental behavior intentions, but rather the norms of the most behaviorally relevant group (
  <a rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90">Terry and Hogg, 1996</a>; 
  <a rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91">Terry et al., 1999</a>). 
  <a rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91">Terry et al. (1999)</a> showed that perceived norms of a behaviorally relevant reference group were related to recycling intentions for group members who were strongly identified. 
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">Fielding et al. (2008b)</a> have also incorporated perceptions of the intergroup context, specifically urban versus rural relations, into the TPB to predict farmers’ intentions to engage in sustainable natural resource management. They showed that these intergroup perceptions emerged as an additional predictor above and beyond the TPB variables. Hence, the social identity approach complements the TPB and can increase its potential to understand and predict environmentally related behavior. It clarifies which norms are likely to influence behavior and highlights the potential of the intergroup context to influence environmental intentions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another well-established approach to understanding environmentally significant individual behavior is the VBN theory proposed by 
  <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">Stern et al. (1999)</a> and 
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">Stern (2000)</a>. This theory proposes a causal sequence that moves from stable values and ecological worldviews to an awareness of consequences for the valued object (e.g., the environment). This in turn influences one’s sense of responsibility to act, which in turn influences personal norms (conceived as an individual’s sense of personal obligation to act on behalf of the environment). At first glance the centrality of personal norms in the VBN runs counter to the primacy of social norms in the social identity perspective. However, the social identity approach conceives of the self as made up of social identity 
  <span class="italic">and</span> personal identities and so these two approaches are not contradictory. Moreover, the VBN is derived from Schwartz’s Moral-Norm-Activation theory and 
  <a rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77">Schwartz (1973)</a> argued that individual expectations that underpin personal norms stem from shared social norms (see 
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">Bratt, 1999</a> for a demonstration of this relationship in relation to recycling). 
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">Stern (2000)</a> also acknowledges that there are a range of factors that feed into environmental behavior, including features of the personal, social, and economic context, and that the influence of personal norms on behavior will depend on the importance of contextual factors. Where the influence of contextual factors are strong, attitudinal factors as outlined in the VBN will be relatively weak predictors of environmental behaviors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This conceptualization allows a comfortable co-existence between the social identity approach and the VBN—in some circumstances personal norms will be the main motivator of behavior whereas in others group-based social identity considerations will come to the fore. Rather than seeing these two theoretical approaches as parallel processes, though, one could also imagine a feedback loop between social and personal identity. Being members of social groups that value the environment could lead ingroup members to internalize these group norms so that they become a strong personal norm. Of course, it is also possible that individuals join groups on the basis of their values and so having environmentally oriented values predisposes people to joining groups that reinforce those values. Ultimately, longitudinal research is needed to disentangle the causal sequence. Short of this, one might expect that personal norms would be strengthened or weakened depending on the social identity that is salient and whether the norms of that identity align with one’s personal norms.</p>
