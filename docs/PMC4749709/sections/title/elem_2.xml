  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identity and Assimilation to Ingroup Norms</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As outlined above, when social identity becomes salient, similarities amongst ingroup members and differences between ingroup and outgroup members are accentuated. As a result, ingroup members assimilate their attitudes and behaviors to ingroup norms and away from outgroup norms. Perhaps the starkest example of this process can be seen in relation to the impact of political party affiliation on climate change attitudes. 
   <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">McCright and Dunlap (2011)</a> have shown that Democrats in the U.S. have greater belief in and concern for climate change than Republicans. These political alignments are confirmed by other U.S. research (
   <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">O’Connor et al., 2002</a>; 
   <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 2006</a>) and extend to other countries. For example in Australia, Labor (a center-left party) and Green party supporters and politicians had greater belief in anthropogenic climate change than (conservative) Liberal/National supporters and politicians (
   <a rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92">Tranter, 2011</a>; 
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Fielding et al., 2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obviously, the relationship between political affiliation and belief in climate change is likely to be bi-directional. Some people will be drawn to a particular party on the basis of their independently formed attitudes toward climate change, meaning that social identity follows individual attitude formation. But a social identity approach would presume that the other causal path – that affiliation influences attitudes – would be even more pronounced. An example of this pathway was provided by 
   <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">Cohen (2003)</a>, who showed that partisan Democrats and Republicans responded to the 
   <span class="italic">very same welfare policies</span> in entirely different ways depending on which party participants were led to believe initiated the policies: when Democrats thought a policy had emanated from the Republican party, they saw the policy as much less moral and acceptable than when the same policy was attributed to the Democrats (and vice versa). This research shows that a message can be rejected or accepted entirely on the basis of the group allegiance of the messenger (
   <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">Hornsey and Imani, 2004</a>; 
   <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">Esposo et al., 2013</a>). Political identities provide salient attitudes, beliefs, and norms that describe and prescribe party supporters’ views on these issues. The majority of the evidence for this argument is correlational, but one recent study provides experimental evidence. 
   <a rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94">Unsworth and Fielding (2014)</a> showed that when political identity was made salient, participants who were aligned with the conservative Liberal/National parties in Australia had lower belief in anthropogenic climate change and were less likely to support climate change policies than those whose identity was not made salient.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further evidence for the influence of ingroup norms comes from norm focus theory which differentiates between injunctive social norms which describe what is approved or desired by group members and descriptive norms which describe what the majority of group members actually do (
   <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Cialdini et al., 1990</a>). The independent and interactive effects of these norms has been demonstrated in the environmental domain including in relation to littering (
   <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Cialdini et al., 1990</a>), towel reuse in hotels (
   <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">Goldstein et al., 2008</a>), energy conservation behavior (
   <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">Nolan et al., 2008</a>; 
   <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">Dwyer et al., 2015</a>), recycling behavior (
   <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Fornara et al., 2011</a>; 
   <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">Long et al., 2014</a>; 
   <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">Schwab et al., 2014</a>), eco-friendly consumer behavior (
   <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">Kim et al., 2012</a>), and intentions to take part in a neighborhood climate protection group (
   <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">Rees and Bamberg, 2014</a>). On the flipside, when American participants were provided with information that Americans are excessive energy consumers (a negative descriptive norm) they were less concerned about climate change and less supportive of climate change policy than when they learned that China was an excessive energy user or they did not receive information (
   <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">Jang, 2013</a>). In other words, American participants conformed to the ingroup descriptive norm, albeit a negative one.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">Goldstein et al. (2008)</a> have also tested whether norms that came from different identities had differing effects on towel reuse. They found that it was the norms that relate to the most relevant and proximal identity—past guests of the participants’ current hotel room – that had the most influence on towel reuse. Although current guests may not necessarily identify strongly with past guests, they share an identity and the behavior of past guests provides the salient script for how to behave in this particular context. Therefore, this finding fits with the social identity approach that people will be guided by the norms of the most behaviorally relevant ingroup in a specific context.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other research has shown that when norms are misaligned or in conflict it can weaken effects on behavior. For example, when there is a lack of alignment between what the ingroup approves of and what they actually do in relation to energy conservation, ingroup members’ energy conservation intentions are undermined (
   <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">Smith et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, perceiving conflict in the pro-environmental descriptive norms across ingroups can either energize or demotivate intentions to act in pro-environmental ways depending on group members’ pre-existing environmental attitudes (
   <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">McDonald et al., 2012</a>, 
   <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The social identity approach also acknowledges that the influence of ingroup norms should be stronger for those who are more highly identified with the group (
   <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">Ellemers et al., 1999</a>). For example, social identification with organic consumers predicts willingness to purchase organic products (
   <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Bartels and Reinders, 2010</a>; 
   <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Bartels and Onwezen, 2014</a>), environmental group membership predicts environmental activism intentions (
   <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">Fielding et al., 2008a</a>), and identification with environmentalists predicts environmental behavior and environmental activism (
   <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">Dono et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, more strongly identified group members are more likely to intend to engage in ingroup normative behaviors, such as recycling (
   <a rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91">Terry et al., 1999</a>; 
   <a rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" href="#B100">White et al., 2009</a>) and sustainable agricultural practices (
   <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">Fielding et al., 2008b</a>). In other words, the more highly identified group members are, the more salient will be the norms of the group and the more likely they will be to guide behavior. Recent research examining different dimensions of ingroup identification has also shown that it is the self-investment dimension of identification (i.e., importance of and satisfaction with the group) that influenced adherence to ingroup norms relating to reducing carbon emissions (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Influence of Intergroup Conflict</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As we noted previously, negative and competitive intergroup relations may arise when ingroup members perceive illegitimate status differences between their own group and other relevant outgroups (
   <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Branscombe et al., 1999</a>; 
   <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Ellemers et al., 2002</a>). In addition to climate change, many other environmental issues are marked by just this type of context: the issues are highly contested and often involve the imposition of regulations and decisions by powerful outgroups. Examples include the imposition of environmental regulation on farmers; water allocation decisions that trade-off between water for the environment, agriculture, and the community; or the conflict between groups over fracking of coal seam gas. These latter contexts are often seen as ‘David and Goliath’ situations where mining companies and government agencies are perceived to be powerful agents who propagate unilateral decisions. Although social identity theory does not argue that all intergroup contexts lead to ingroup bias and outgroup derogation, the power differences and perceived illegitimacy that flows from these types of contexts can lead ingroup members to perceive the decisions as unfair and to resist them. A study by 
   <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">Fielding et al. (2008b)</a>, for example, showed that when rural landholders perceived more negative relations between rural and urban Australia (with urban Australia the site of government who develop regulation that impacts on rural landholders) they had lower intentions to manage their riparian zones.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When people come into conflict over environmental issues or resources, their social identities come to the fore. People stereotype each other in ingroup-favoring ways (e.g., “we are the defenders of the environment, they are the destroyers”) and outgroup members are denigrated and can be morally excluded from the scope of justice (
   <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">Opotow and Weiss, 2000</a>; 
   <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">Opotow and Brook, 2003</a>). Research by 
   <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">Opotow and Brook (2003)</a> provides evidence of these processes in the context of environmental protection regulation. When a threatened species act was introduced, ranchers and environmentalists came into conflict. The ranchers viewed the threatened species as insignificant, and characterized non-ranchers as inexperienced, irresponsible, and the cause of the problem. In contrast, ranchers viewed themselves as stewards of the environment who made fair environmental decisions. Despite their espoused environmental stewardship, ranchers were wary of government regulation to protect wildlife, a stance that reinforces environmentalists’ notions that ranchers are anti-environment.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, some environmental issues can give rise to emergent group identities that center around strongly held positions [i.e., opinion-based groups (
   <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">McGarty et al., 2009</a>)]. For example, 
   <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">Bliuc et al. (2015)</a> found that U.S. respondents saw their position as a climate “believer” or “skeptic” as distinct social identities in their own right, and that they perceived each other through a hostile intergroup lens. When political affiliation overlaps with these opinion-based identities, identity faultlines can emerge that make objective appraisals of evidence psychologically implausible. Another example of conflict giving rise to emergent social identities is the conflict that has arisen over fracking of coal seam gas in Australia. Unlikely alliances have emerged between environmental group members, farmers, conservative politicians, and media presenters who oppose fracking, with government agencies and mining companies perceived as the salient outgroup (
   <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">Hutton, 2012</a>; 
   <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">Colvin et al., 2015b</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are important consequences of these identities that emerge out of environmental conflict. The alignment of climate change attitudes with political party identity lends an intense and competitive intergroup dynamic to what should be even-handed discussions about science and truth. When framed within an entrenched intergroup context, solutions advanced by one political party are likely to be dismissed by political opponents simply because they emanate from the outgroup. Similarly, in relation to the ‘Lock the gate’ movement, the emergent social identity becomes a short cut for deciding whether someone is friend or foe and whether to attend to or trust information from them. To the extent that information comes from people, who are perceived to be aligned with the outgroup, ingroup members are more likely to dismiss it regardless of its veracity (
   <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Abrams et al., 1990</a>; 
   <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">Mackie and Queller, 2000</a>; 
   <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">Esposo et al., 2013</a>). In this way intergroup distinctions become entrenched and the potential to reach compromise or develop viable solutions becomes less likely.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although intergroup conflict can stymy progress on environmental issues, it should be noted that a degree of intergroup conflict is inevitable when pushing for social change, and that the alternative to conflict is often an unhealthy stasis. The social identity model of collective action (SIMCA; 
   <a rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" href="#B99">van Zomeren et al., 2008</a>) highlights the fact that collective action is an important precursor for change, and that willingness to engage in collective action is partly driven by identification with social groups. In their meta-analysis of the collective action literature, 
   <a rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" href="#B99">van Zomeren et al. (2008)</a> showed that stronger social identifications were associated with greater willingness to engage in collective action, and that this was particularly the case when identification was measured with respect to a disadvantaged group or a social movement (so-called “politicized” identities). Other research demonstrates that group identification is positively associated with the belief that the group can be effective in reaching its collective goals (
   <a rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" href="#B98">van Zomeren et al., 2010</a>), suggesting a virtuous cycle of identification leading to action leading to positive change leading back to identification.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of course, reality is more complex than this: whether or not collective action readiness is viewed as positive and legitimate will likely depend on the type of collective action (whether it is violent or non-violent; whether it involves trade-offs with economic goals, etc.). Furthermore, although environmental collective action often involves a range of people from many walks of life, research has shown that people hold negative stereotypes of environmentalists as militant, aggressive, unconventional, and eccentric (
   <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Bashir et al., 2013</a>). 
   <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Bashir et al. (2013)</a> showed that participants had lower pro-environmental intentions when they were exposed to an article promoting environmental sustainability written by a journalist who was a typical environmentalist (i.e., a person who organizes rallies to protest harmful chemicals) than one who was an atypical environmentalist. With this in mind it is easy to see how messages that emanate from environmental groups that are perceived to be extreme may gain little traction with the broader populace and could even polarize people away from support for important environmental issues (
   <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">Bliuc et al., 2015</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Fluidity of Social Identity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The social identity approach recognizes that social identities are not fixed; rather, they are dynamic and flexible, changing in people’s minds as a function of the comparative context. Two key factors influence which social identities guide behavior: fit and accessibility (
   <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">Oakes et al., 1991</a>). Comparative fit refers to the degree to which a social identity is seen to reflect real world differences between groups. Normative fit recognizes that categorization is a dynamic process that reflects the perceptions of perceivers; that is, people are more likely to categorize into ingroups and outgroups if differences between groups align with stereotypic expectations. Social identities are also more or less likely to become the basis for self-definition depending on how accessible they are; some are fleetingly accessible if primed (e.g., one’s identity as a guest in a hotel room) whereas others are chronically accessible because they are frequently activated (e.g., a workplace social identity).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some recent research demonstrates the fluid nature of social identities in the environmental domain. 
   <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">Rabinovich et al. (2012)</a> showed that British participants judged the British as more pro-environmental when a less environmental nation (USA) was the salient outgroup comparison whereas the British were judged to be less environmental when a more environmental nation (Sweden) was the salient outgroup. Moreover, participants’ environmental values, intentions and behavioral choices shifted in line with the national stereotype. Thus, the stereotype of the group and group members’ self-conception polarized away from the comparison outgroup. In a similar vein, when students compared themselves to past students (assumed to be less pro-environmental) they judged current students to be more pro-environmental but when comparing current students with future students (assumed to be more pro-environmental) they judged current students to be less pro-environmental (
   <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Ferguson et al., 2011</a>). Willingness to engage in sustainable behaviors also varied in line with the perceived ingroup norms, that is, there was greater willingness when participants compared with past students than when they compared with future students.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These findings demonstrate how the intergroup comparative context can influence the content of social identity in ways that could facilitate or inhibit greater engagement in pro-environmental behavior and greater support for pro-environmental policy. Although communicators might intuitively be tempted to highlight a relevant outgroup’s superior environmental record as a way to motivate ingroup action, this may not be fruitful as it could send a negative descriptive norm message to ingroup members. On the other hand, highlighting the superior environmental record of the ingroup relative to other salient outgroups could help to construct a more pro-environmental ingroup stereotype that may have flow-on benefits in terms of influencing ingroup members’ own environmental behavior or their support for environmental policies.</p>
