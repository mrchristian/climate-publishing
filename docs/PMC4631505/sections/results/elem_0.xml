 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The threshold-independent area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) measure of model accuracy revealed high predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.94 ± 0.008). The threshold habitat suitability chosen to maximize model sensitivity at 0.90 was 0.36; all pixels with habitat suitability above the threshold were considered “suitable” and those below the threshold were considered “unsuitable.” Specificity (% of pseudo-absences correctly classified) was 0.86, and the RF model performed within the ‘excellent’ range of the kappa index (kappa = 0.73; [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat suitability under baseline climate was greatest at high elevations inside Strathcona Provincial Park in the center of Vancouver Island, with small patches of highly suitable habitat in the northern and southern mountains (
  <a rid="pone.0142110.g004" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0142110.g004">Fig 4</a>). Habitat suitability declined across all of Vancouver Island by the 2080s under both RCP scenarios. Most of ptarmigan baseline range is predicted to contain only low suitability habitat by the 2080s under the highest greenhouse gas scenario (RCP 8.5). Habitat suitability is predicted to remain highest within the Forbidden Plateau region in the southeast corner of Strathcona Provincial Park, with a fairly large patch of moderately to highly suitable habitat remaining by 2085 under the lower greenhouse gas scenario but only a few small patches of moderately suitable habitat remaining under the high greenhouse gas scenario.

Habitat decline is predicted to occur gradually, with an average range change of -25% (± 2), -44% (± 11), and -56% (± 2) by the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, under the RCP 4.5 scenario and -27% (± 2), -59% (± 8), and -74% (± 2) under the RCP 8.5 scenario (

Predictions of range change differed markedly under the two greenhouse gas scenarios; more habitat was predicted to be lost by the 2050s under the RCP 8.5 scenario than by the 2080s under the RCP 4.5 scenario. The three general circulation models (GCMs) showed strong agreement in their predictions of the future distribution of suitable ptarmigan habitat and indicated that remaining suitable habitat will be located within Strathcona Provincial Park, with little to no remaining habitat in the southern ranges and only small, isolated habitat patches in the northern ranges by 2085 (
