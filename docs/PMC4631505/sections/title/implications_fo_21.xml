 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The configuration of future habitat is important when modeling shifts in climate envelopes in part because of the importance of micro- and macrorefugia in allowing the persistence of populations. VIWTP may show resilience to climate change-induced habitat loss through the use of microrefugia. Microrefugia differ from macrorefugia in that they are small areas with unusual microclimates that allow species to persist in areas that might be deemed unsuitable according to average background climates [

  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref061">61</a>]. Coarse scale species distribution models tend to overestimate extinction risk because they use climate grids that are too coarse to predict locations of fine-scale topographic relief that may provide microrefugia [

  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref063">63</a>]. Although we used a smaller climate grid (100 m) than many species distribution modeling studies, we acknowledge that we can still only identify climate macrorefugia. Randin 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref064">64</a>] found that local-scale models (25 m grid cells) predicted some persistence of suitable habitats at high elevations for European plant species that were predicted to lose all of their suitable habitat according to large-scale models (10′ grid cells). Similarly, ptarmigan may be able to utilize microclimates created by fine-scale landscape features (e.g., boulders, ravines, and water bodies), vegetation type, or small variations in slope or aspect not accounted for in our models to persist in habitat that is predicted to be lost (see [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref065">65</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref066">66</a>]). In contrast, Trivedi 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref067">67</a>] found that coarse scale models overestimated species thermal tolerances and underestimated the potential impact of climate change on high elevation species compared to local-scale models, suggesting that microclimatic refugia may not allow for persistence as speculated.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if ptarmigan can utilize microrefugia, it is unlikely that populations will be able to persist in their current numbers. Extinction probability increases with reduced range size and connectivity [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref068">68</a>], and climate change will increase the variability of extreme temperatures and weather events in high elevation habitats [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref069">69</a>]. Ptarmigan must be able to live and reproduce through these extreme episodes if they are to persist. Alpine birds tend to exhibit slower life histories than low elevation populations of the same or similar species, where high elevation individuals have the lowest breeding success but higher survival [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref070">70</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref071">71</a>]. More frequent episodes of extreme conditions may alter the fitness consequences of alternative life-history strategies and exceed the coping abilities of alpine-breeding birds.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The persistence of populations in the central and northern regions of Vancouver Island will depend partially on the ability of birds to utilize smaller areas at higher densities. Alpine ibex (
  <span class="italic">Capra ibex</span>) have shown intensified density dependence under unfavourable climatic conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref072">72</a>], which also may be the case for ptarmigan especially if the quality of “suitable” habitat declines. For instance, ptarmigan may encounter more competition from lower elevation competitors such as Sooty Grouse (
  <span class="italic">Dendragapus fuliginosus</span>) and increased predation pressure from generalist predators such as ravens, particularly around nest sites [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref073">73</a>]. This potential replacement of an alpine specialist with generalist competitors and increased predators corresponds to recent findings in Europe, where local species assemblages are increasingly composed of native habitat generalists [
