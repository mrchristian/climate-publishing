 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our approach predicts that Vancouver Island White-tailed Ptarmigan may lose a substantial portion of their habitat as early as the 2020s, as patches become smaller and increasingly fragmented. The GCMs differed very little in their estimates of habitat loss and configuration, whereas greenhouse gas concentration scenarios depicted very different futures for VIWTP habitat. By the 2080s, we predict VIWTP will lose at least 53%, or as high as 77%, of their habitat under the low and high greenhouse gas scenarios, respectively. Our predictions are consistent with predictions of significant range contractions for other high elevation specialist species as a consequence of global climate change [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After elevation, mean summer temperature and precipitation as snow were the second and third most important variables for predicting VIWTP distributions. Changes in these climate variables will likely drive habitat loss. Increased annual mean summer temperature will likely correspond with increased frequency of extreme heat days, which may stress birds and lead to reduced fecundity or survival [

   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref031">31</a>]. Warmer summers and reduced snowfall will also lead to the loss of permanent snow fields, which are important for ptarmigan thermoregulation and for providing sufficient moisture for ptarmigan forage [

   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref055">55</a>]. Additionally, ptarmigan moult is primarily influenced by photoperiod and not climate [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref056">56</a>]. As the number of snow-free days during the year increase, birds with white plumage against a dark background may be at increased risk of predation, especially independent but naive juveniles. Birds may adapt to changing conditions through evolutionary changes in their molt response to photoperiod and increased ability to tolerate heat, but such selective responses are likely to be slow [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change greatly impacts spatial configuration of VIWTP habitat</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While many studies project future range shifts for wildlife, the spatial configuration and connectivity of future habitats has been less well addressed. Our work predicts that VIWTP habitat will become increasingly fragmented and confined to mountaintops. Climate change will likely cause fragmentation of VIWTP habitat by facilitating infilling of trees and shrubs into previously open alpine tundra [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref008">8</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref009">9</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref058">58</a>], a process already documented at high elevations on Vancouver Island [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref025">25</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref026">26</a>]. The effects of habitat fragmentation on VIWTP persistence will depend on their home range size and dispersal ability. Substantial movement of VIWTP genes occurs across the landscape and high allelic richness is found even among the most isolated populations [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref059">59</a>]. Female White-tailed Ptarmigan in Colorado can move long distances to other breeding areas without incurring reproductive or survival costs during the breeding season [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref034">34</a>]. These studies suggest that ptarmigan may be able to persist on Vancouver Island despite increasing habitat fragmentation due to their apparent ability to move between patches, at least for the initial periods of change. Still, our results predict the disappearance of nearly all of the ptarmigan habitat south of Strathcona Provincial Park by the 2080s. Large areas of unsuitable low elevation habitat act as a barrier to VIWTP gene flow, as the southern populations appeared to be smaller and more temporally variable [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref059">59</a>]. Thus, these southern populations may well be extirpated by climate-induced habitat loss within 70 years. The ability of ptarmigan to disperse between smaller and more spatially fragmented habitat patches will be an important predictor of VIWTP long-term viability, and future research should examine VIWTP dispersal distance as a function of future climates in order to inform management and conservation of the subspecies.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under all climate change scenarios, our results predict substantial decline in the average suitable patch size for VIWTP by the 2080s, including loss of most large patches and an increasing number of very small patches. Although average patch size is predicted to decline gradually from the 2020s–2080s, total number of patches is predicted to decline by the 2020s but then increase in the 2050s and 2080s. The predicted reduction in number of patches by the 2020s primarily reflects the disappearance of most very small patches of currently suitable habitat. By the 2080s, however, most current larger patches are predicted to become fragmented into several smaller patches, increasing the total number of patches but lowering average patch size. As shown by [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref033">33</a>], there is likely a demographic cost for VIWTP persisting in smaller patches. Alpine habitat already exists as small, fragmented “sky islands” on Vancouver Island compared to interior alpine, which is more continuous. Further fragmentation and reduction in patch size of VIWTP habitat will likely be detrimental to ptarmigan breeding success [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref033">33</a>] and may also hinder dispersal and increase the ecological cost of movement, as birds will increasingly be forced to cross unsuitable habitat in order to reach suitable breeding patches. Finally, the average elevation of suitable habitat patches is expected to increase by the 2080s, reflecting a loss of patches at lower elevations. Thus ptarmigan are in danger of being “squeezed off the mountain”, as their remaining suitable habitat will be increasingly confined to mountaintops.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implications for VIWTP population persistence and the importance of refugia</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The configuration of future habitat is important when modeling shifts in climate envelopes in part because of the importance of micro- and macrorefugia in allowing the persistence of populations. VIWTP may show resilience to climate change-induced habitat loss through the use of microrefugia. Microrefugia differ from macrorefugia in that they are small areas with unusual microclimates that allow species to persist in areas that might be deemed unsuitable according to average background climates [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref060">60</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref061">61</a>]. Coarse scale species distribution models tend to overestimate extinction risk because they use climate grids that are too coarse to predict locations of fine-scale topographic relief that may provide microrefugia [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref062">62</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref063">63</a>]. Although we used a smaller climate grid (100 m) than many species distribution modeling studies, we acknowledge that we can still only identify climate macrorefugia. Randin 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref064">64</a>] found that local-scale models (25 m grid cells) predicted some persistence of suitable habitats at high elevations for European plant species that were predicted to lose all of their suitable habitat according to large-scale models (10′ grid cells). Similarly, ptarmigan may be able to utilize microclimates created by fine-scale landscape features (e.g., boulders, ravines, and water bodies), vegetation type, or small variations in slope or aspect not accounted for in our models to persist in habitat that is predicted to be lost (see [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref065">65</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref066">66</a>]). In contrast, Trivedi 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref067">67</a>] found that coarse scale models overestimated species thermal tolerances and underestimated the potential impact of climate change on high elevation species compared to local-scale models, suggesting that microclimatic refugia may not allow for persistence as speculated.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if ptarmigan can utilize microrefugia, it is unlikely that populations will be able to persist in their current numbers. Extinction probability increases with reduced range size and connectivity [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref068">68</a>], and climate change will increase the variability of extreme temperatures and weather events in high elevation habitats [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref069">69</a>]. Ptarmigan must be able to live and reproduce through these extreme episodes if they are to persist. Alpine birds tend to exhibit slower life histories than low elevation populations of the same or similar species, where high elevation individuals have the lowest breeding success but higher survival [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref070">70</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref071">71</a>]. More frequent episodes of extreme conditions may alter the fitness consequences of alternative life-history strategies and exceed the coping abilities of alpine-breeding birds.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The persistence of populations in the central and northern regions of Vancouver Island will depend partially on the ability of birds to utilize smaller areas at higher densities. Alpine ibex (
   <span class="italic">Capra ibex</span>) have shown intensified density dependence under unfavourable climatic conditions [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref072">72</a>], which also may be the case for ptarmigan especially if the quality of “suitable” habitat declines. For instance, ptarmigan may encounter more competition from lower elevation competitors such as Sooty Grouse (
   <span class="italic">Dendragapus fuliginosus</span>) and increased predation pressure from generalist predators such as ravens, particularly around nest sites [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref073">73</a>]. This potential replacement of an alpine specialist with generalist competitors and increased predators corresponds to recent findings in Europe, where local species assemblages are increasingly composed of native habitat generalists [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strengths and limitations of climate envelope models</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The choice of a threshold for determining habitat suitability with species distribution models can be subjective, especially when reliable absence data are not available [
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref039">39</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0142110.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref075">75</a>]. We used a threshold that maximized sensitivity (set at 0.90) to correctly predict the largest number of ptarmigan presence locations while attempting to avoid overpredicting habitat suitability across the landscape by setting sensitivity too high. However, as in most studies of this kind, we cannot be sure that areas without ptarmigan sightings represent unsuitable summer habitat. A series of initial trials revealed that our choice of threshold and resulting estimates of habitat loss were conservative; other methodological choices for setting a threshold, such as maximizing model accuracy according to kappa or setting a lower sensitivity, resulted in smaller estimates of suitable habitat area and greater predictions for climate-induced habitat loss. By utilizing a threshold that slightly over-predicts baseline suitable habitat for VIWTP, we minimized the chances of “missing” areas of suitable habitat and overestimating habitat loss as often occurs in climate envelope studies [
