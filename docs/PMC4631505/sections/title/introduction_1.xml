 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate-related range shifts are discernable across the globe for many animal species [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref001">1</a>] and clear fingerprints related to climate change are detectable on bird species assemblages [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref002">2</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref003">3</a>]. Mountain ecosystems are among the most at risk from climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref004">4</a>]. Mountains often have high levels of biodiversity and harbour large numbers of endemic species [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref006">6</a>], many of which are restricted to alpine habitats [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref007">7</a>]. Such habitats are gradually being lost due to tree and shrub encroachment [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref009">9</a>], resulting in range contractions of alpine species at their lower altitudinal limits [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref010">10</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref011">11</a>]. With no room “at the top” for upward expansion, alpine species face habitat loss and fragmentation and, ultimately, risk of extinction [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref012">12</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref014">14</a>]. Increased competition from invasive species and low elevation generalists may further accelerate population declines for alpine specialist species under a warming climate [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref015">15</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref016">16</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coastal temperate mountains are particularly vulnerable to climate change as they occur at lower elevations compared to interior mountains and contain a smaller area of alpine habitat [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref017">17</a>]. Relatively little is known about the importance of alpine ecosystems for avian biodiversity, and most large-scale bird sampling schemes, including citizen science programs such as eBird and the Breeding Bird Survey, lack adequate reports from high elevations because of their relative inaccessibility and low population densities [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref018">18</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref019">19</a>]. However, British Columbia’s coastal mountains, including those on Vancouver Island, harbour a remarkable diversity of birds, many of which are of conservation concern and threatened by climate change ([
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref020">20</a>], Boyle and Martin, 
  <span class="italic">In Review</span>). Other threatened wildlife taxa depending on these coastal montane ecosystems are similarly difficult to study, such as mountain goats (
  <span class="italic">Oreamnos americanus)</span> and the critically endangered, endemic Vancouver Island Marmot (
  <span class="italic">Marmota vancouverensis</span>; [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref021">21</a>]). In general, North America’s coastal alpine are remarkably understudied, in part due to their extremely rugged terrain and restricted road and trail access.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the past decade, the Pacific Northwest of North America has experienced a significant warming trend (roughly 0.5–1.5°C; [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref022">22</a>]). Temperatures are predicted to continue to warm across all seasons at rates comparable to or higher than current rates, with variable predictions for precipitation [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref023">23</a>]. Such changes will accelerate woody vegetation growth in former alpine tundra; for instance, Flower 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref024">24</a>] predict rapid upward shifts in elevational range for both Douglas Fir (
  <span class="italic">Pseudotsuga menziesii</span>) and spruce (
  <span class="italic">Picea</span> spp.) in British Columbia, and Laroque 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref025">25</a>] used dendroclimatological analysis to document climate-related pulses of tree establishment at high elevations on southern Vancouver Island during the 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century. They predicted rapid infilling of alpine meadow sites within 10–20 years, with negative consequences for montane meadow-dependent wildlife. Subsequent research has shown that infilling by trees and shrubs at high elevations occurred on Vancouver Island between 1962 and 2005 [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref026">26</a>]. Such expansion of woody vegetation leads not only to loss of suitable habitat for alpine species but also to habitat fragmentation and loss of connectivity. Most studies investigating potential climate-induced range changes for wildlife focus primarily on habitat loss and shifting climate envelopes, but fragmentation may also play a crucial role, particularly for alpine species with limited room “at the top” for tracking climate envelopes upward in elevation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Vancouver Island White-tailed Ptarmigan (
  <span class="italic">Lagopus leucura saxatilis</span>; hereafter VIWTP) is endemic to Vancouver Island and was designated a subspecies in 1939 based on unique morphological characteristics [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref027">27</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref028">28</a>]. An alpine specialist bird that spends its entire life history above the treeline, VIWTP was blue-listed as vulnerable by the British Columbia government in 1992 given its endemic status and low density [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref029">29</a>]. White-tailed Ptarmigan are adapted to cold environments and cannot physiologically tolerate hot temperatures [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref030">30</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref031">31</a>]. They rely on permanent snow fields for thermoregulation [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref031">31</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref032">32</a>] and areas with sufficient moisture (from summer precipitation and snowmelt) for food such as ericaceous shrubs, grasses, and forbs [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref033">33</a>]. Because the coastal alpine comprises lower elevations than interior mountains, VIWTP habitat exists as smaller, more fragmented “sky island” patches than interior White-tailed Ptarmigan habitat on the mainland. For example, the size of alpine patches comprehensively surveyed for VIWTP in 1997 varied from 0.14 to 7.10 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (KM unpublished info) versus 2.7 to &gt; 13.2 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in Colorado [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref034">34</a>]. Although ptarmigan have persisted on Vancouver Island, there is likely a demographic cost to utilizing smaller habitat patches. For instance, VIWTP in the central island (with larger, more continuous patches of alpine) had higher breeding success and higher adult survival than birds in the more fragmented south island populations in 2011 [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref033">33</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of their physiological requirements and the fact that their habitat exists as smaller alpine patches at lower elevations than mainland White-tailed Ptarmigan [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref035">35</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref036">36</a>], VIWTP are threatened primarily by climate change. Wang et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref037">37</a>] modeled the relationships between 44 climate variables and the distribution of 16 biogeoclimatic zones in British Columbia. They found that the Coastal Mountain-heather Alpine zone, upon which VIWTP primarily depend, is predicted to decline by nearly 50% by the 2080s based on a single consensus map that incorporated 20 climate change scenarios, with near total loss predicted for Vancouver Island. They predict alpine ecosystems will be replaced by Coastal Western Hemlock forests, potentially resulting in increased forest productivity and carbon sequestration at the expense of habitat for alpine specialist species [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref037">37</a>]. Survey efforts combined with museum records and other historic sources revealed that VIWTP still occupied the same mountains on Vancouver Island in 2004 as they had occupied historically (early to mid-1900s; [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref035">35</a>]). However, this study was coarse in scale and did not examine the effects of climate or topography on ptarmigan habitat. As climate change accelerates, adequate conservation of VIWTP will ultimately depend on detailed knowledge of the amount and configuration of suitable breeding habitat predicted under current and future climates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species distribution models can be a useful tool for assessing the impacts of environmental change and the distribution of organisms. In a previous study describing the quantity and location of suitable ptarmigan breeding habitat on Vancouver Island, we showed that species distribution models trained using opportunistic observations submitted by hikers (citizen science) are comparable in quality and predictions to models trained using time- and cost-intensive field survey data [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref036">36</a>]. Thus, although large-scale avian citizen science platforms such as eBird may not adequately capture observations from alpine regions, localized and species-specific citizen science programs can provide valuable information about elusive alpine species such as VIWTP. Here, we build on our comparison of five modeling techniques using citizen science and field survey input data to investigate how climate change will alter the size, distribution, and configuration of suitable VIWTP breeding habitat. Specifically, we ask how the total amount, mean patch size and number of patches of suitable VIWTP habitat will change by the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s due to climate change. Our study identifies areas of highest vulnerability and guides future plans for conservation of this threatened subspecies, along with providing a baseline for future studies of connectivity for mountain wildlife across increasingly fragmented habitat.
