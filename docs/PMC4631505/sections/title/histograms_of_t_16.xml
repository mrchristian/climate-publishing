 <p>Baseline climate (1980â€“2010) is shown in black, future climate for the 2080s is shown in white, and their overlap is shown in gray. Future climate is represented by three general circulation models: CanESM2 (Can), CCSM4 (CCSM), and GFDL-CM3 (GFDL), and two emissions scenarios (top row = RCP 4.5 and bottom row = RCP 8.5).</p>
