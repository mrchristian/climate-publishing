 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To model ptarmigan occurrence, we used eight abiotic variables believed to influence ptarmigan distribution (
  <a rid="pone.0142110.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0142110.t001">Table 1</a>). Five topographic variables included elevation, aspect, slope, compound topographic index (CTI, commonly referred to as a wetness index), and a vector ruggedness measure (VRM). All topographic variables were derived from a 100-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Aspect and slope were calculated using ArcGIS Spatial Analyst. We transformed aspect as x = -1*cos[Ø(π/180)], where Ø is the aspect measured in degrees. Values ranged from -1 where the angle of solar incidence was lower (north-facing slopes) to 1 where it was higher (south-facing slopes). The importance of aspect depends on slope, so we assigned aspects with slopes of &lt;5° a neutral value of 0 [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref044">44</a>]. CTI was calculated based on the slope and upstream contributing area orthogonal to the flow direction [
  <a rid="pone.0142110.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0142110.ref045">45</a>], so that low values represent small catchments such as steep slopes or ridges and high values represent large catchments such as gentle slopes or depressions. VRM is an integrative measure of terrain heterogeneity based on slope and aspect, and was calculated using neighbourhoods of nine pixel cells. Ruggedness values can range from 0 (no terrain variation, or a smooth surface) to 1 (extremely rugged terrain with high variability in slope and aspect; [

We used mean summer temperature, mean summer precipitation, and precipitation as snow to model ptarmigan distribution. These climate variables reflected prior knowledge about White-tailed Ptarmigan energy and water constraints [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To model the distribution of VIWTP in the future, we extracted the above climate predictors from ClimateBC for the 2020s (2010–2039), 2050s (2040–2069), and 2080s (2070–2099) across three general circulation models (GCMs): CanESM2 from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, CCSM4 from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and GFDL-CM3 from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) from the International Panel on Climate Change AR5 report: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. We chose these three GCMs to represent a range of possible climate futures on Vancouver Island based on scatter plots of future temperature and precipitation using all 16 GCMs made available through ClimateBC. The GFDL model predicts a hot, moderately wet future, the CanESM2 model predicts a hot, very wet future, and the CCSM model predicts the least change in both temperature and precipitation (
  <a rid="pone.0142110.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0142110.g002">Fig 2</a>). The RCP 4.5 scenario represents lower future greenhouse gas concentrations and more conservative predictions of climate change, whereas the RCP 8.5 scenario represents higher future greenhouse gas concentrations and a more extreme climate change scenario. In order to predict future ptarmigan distribution, we extracted the three climate predictors for every cell in the 100-m DEM covering all of Vancouver Island for each GCM and greenhouse gas scenario combination.
