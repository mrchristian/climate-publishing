 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in the configuration of alpine habitat, including fragmentation and increasing confinement to high elevation mountaintops, will likely play a large role in driving the responses of alpine wildlife to climate change. VIWTP, along with other alpine specialists, are in danger of being “squeezed off the mountain” as alpine habitat declines in total area and mean patch size. Our results also emphasize that regardless of changes in habitat size and connectivity and the threshold chosen to define “suitable” ptarmigan habitat, habitat quality will be reduced from the birds’ point of view. This reduction in quality may manifest in several ways including physiological intolerance to warming, reduced survival or brood failure due to increased frequency of extreme weather events, lower food availability, and/or increased competition or predation. Little is known about the potential fate of North America’s coastal alpine ecosystems under climate change or the ability of alpine animals to cope with deteriorating habitat quality. Because our study has implications for other high elevation specialist species with similarly restricted ranges, White-tailed Ptarmigan can be considered an indicator species for coastal alpine ecosystems in the face of climate change.</p>
