With little room &#x0201c;at the top&#x0201d; to track shifting climate envelopes, alpine species may be especially negatively affected by climate-induced habitat fragmentation. We ask how climate change will affect the total amount, mean patch size, and number of patches of suitable habitat for Vancouver Island White-tailed Ptarmigan (<italic>Lagopus leucura saxatilis</italic>; VIWTP), a threatened, endemic alpine bird. Using a Random Forest model and a unique dataset consisting of citizen science observations combined with field surveys, we predict the distribution and configuration of potential suitable summer habitat for VIWTP under baseline and future (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s) climates using three general circulation models and two greenhouse gas scenarios. VIWTP summer habitat is predicted to decline by an average of 25%, 44%, and 56% by the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, under the low greenhouse gas scenario and 27%, 59%, and 74% under the high scenario. Habitat patches are predicted to become fragmented, with a 52&#x02013;79% reduction in mean patch size. The average elevation of suitable habitat patches is expected to increase, reflecting a loss of patches at lower elevations. Thus ptarmigan are in danger of being &#x0201c;squeezed off the mountain&#x0201d;, as their remaining suitable habitat will be increasingly confined to mountaintops in the center of the island. The extent to which ptarmigan will be able to persist in increasingly fragmented habitat is unclear. Much will depend on their ability to move throughout a more heterogeneous landscape, utilize smaller breeding areas, and survive increasingly variable climate extremes. Our results emphasize the importance of continued monitoring and protection for high elevation specialist species, and suggest that White-tailed Ptarmigan should be considered an indicator species for alpine ecosystems in the face of climate change.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this research was provided by TerreWEB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://terreweb.ubc.ca">http://terreweb.ubc.ca</ext-link>), a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca">http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca</ext-link>) Collaborative Research and Training Experience (CREATE) fellowship program at the University of British Columbia to M.J.

Mountain ecosystems are among the most at risk from climate change [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Mountains often have high levels of biodiversity and harbour large numbers of endemic species [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], many of which are restricted to alpine habitats [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Such habitats are gradually being lost due to tree and shrub encroachment [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], resulting in range contractions of alpine species at their lower altitudinal limits [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. With no room &#x0201c;at the top&#x0201d; for upward expansion, alpine species face habitat loss and fragmentation and, ultimately, risk of extinction [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Increased competition from invasive species and low elevation generalists may further accelerate population declines for alpine specialist species under a warming climate [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Coastal temperate mountains are particularly vulnerable to climate change as they occur at lower elevations compared to interior mountains and contain a smaller area of alpine habitat [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Relatively little is known about the importance of alpine ecosystems for avian biodiversity, and most large-scale bird sampling schemes, including citizen science programs such as eBird and the Breeding Bird Survey, lack adequate reports from high elevations because of their relative inaccessibility and low population densities [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, British Columbia&#x02019;s coastal mountains, including those on Vancouver Island, harbour a remarkable diversity of birds, many of which are of conservation concern and threatened by climate change ([<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], Boyle and Martin, <italic>In Review</italic>). Other threatened wildlife taxa depending on these coastal montane ecosystems are similarly difficult to study, such as mountain goats (<italic>Oreamnos americanus)</italic> and the critically endangered, endemic Vancouver Island Marmot (<italic>Marmota vancouverensis</italic>; [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). In general, North America&#x02019;s coastal alpine are remarkably understudied, in part due to their extremely rugged terrain and restricted road and trail access.</p><p>Over the past decade, the Pacific Northwest of North America has experienced a significant warming trend (roughly 0.5&#x02013;1.5&#x000b0;C; [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). Temperatures are predicted to continue to warm across all seasons at rates comparable to or higher than current rates, with variable predictions for precipitation [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Such changes will accelerate woody vegetation growth in former alpine tundra; for instance, Flower <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] predict rapid upward shifts in elevational range for both Douglas Fir (<italic>Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic>) and spruce (<italic>Picea</italic> spp.) in British Columbia, and Laroque <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] used dendroclimatological analysis to document climate-related pulses of tree establishment at high elevations on southern Vancouver Island during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. They predicted rapid infilling of alpine meadow sites within 10&#x02013;20 years, with negative consequences for montane meadow-dependent wildlife. Subsequent research has shown that infilling by trees and shrubs at high elevations occurred on Vancouver Island between 1962 and 2005 [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Such expansion of woody vegetation leads not only to loss of suitable habitat for alpine species but also to habitat fragmentation and loss of connectivity. Most studies investigating potential climate-induced range changes for wildlife focus primarily on habitat loss and shifting climate envelopes, but fragmentation may also play a crucial role, particularly for alpine species with limited room &#x0201c;at the top&#x0201d; for tracking climate envelopes upward in elevation.</p><p>The Vancouver Island White-tailed Ptarmigan (<italic>Lagopus leucura saxatilis</italic>; hereafter VIWTP) is endemic to Vancouver Island and was designated a subspecies in 1939 based on unique morphological characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. An alpine specialist bird that spends its entire life history above the treeline, VIWTP was blue-listed as vulnerable by the British Columbia government in 1992 given its endemic status and low density [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. White-tailed Ptarmigan are adapted to cold environments and cannot physiologically tolerate hot temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. They rely on permanent snow fields for thermoregulation [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and areas with sufficient moisture (from summer precipitation and snowmelt) for food such as ericaceous shrubs, grasses, and forbs [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Because the coastal alpine comprises lower elevations than interior mountains, VIWTP habitat exists as smaller, more fragmented &#x0201c;sky island&#x0201d; patches than interior White-tailed Ptarmigan habitat on the mainland. For example, the size of alpine patches comprehensively surveyed for VIWTP in 1997 varied from 0.14 to 7.10 km<sup>2</sup> (KM unpublished info) versus 2.7 to &#x0003e; 13.2 km<sup>2</sup> in Colorado [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although ptarmigan have persisted on Vancouver Island, there is likely a demographic cost to utilizing smaller habitat patches. For instance, VIWTP in the central island (with larger, more continuous patches of alpine) had higher breeding success and higher adult survival than birds in the more fragmented south island populations in 2011 [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Because of their physiological requirements and the fact that their habitat exists as smaller alpine patches at lower elevations than mainland White-tailed Ptarmigan [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], VIWTP are threatened primarily by climate change. Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] modeled the relationships between 44 climate variables and the distribution of 16 biogeoclimatic zones in British Columbia. They found that the Coastal Mountain-heather Alpine zone, upon which VIWTP primarily depend, is predicted to decline by nearly 50% by the 2080s based on a single consensus map that incorporated 20 climate change scenarios, with near total loss predicted for Vancouver Island. They predict alpine ecosystems will be replaced by Coastal Western Hemlock forests, potentially resulting in increased forest productivity and carbon sequestration at the expense of habitat for alpine specialist species [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Survey efforts combined with museum records and other historic sources revealed that VIWTP still occupied the same mountains on Vancouver Island in 2004 as they had occupied historically (early to mid-1900s; [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). However, this study was coarse in scale and did not examine the effects of climate or topography on ptarmigan habitat. As climate change accelerates, adequate conservation of VIWTP will ultimately depend on detailed knowledge of the amount and configuration of suitable breeding habitat predicted under current and future climates.</p><p>Species distribution models can be a useful tool for assessing the impacts of environmental change and the distribution of organisms. In a previous study describing the quantity and location of suitable ptarmigan breeding habitat on Vancouver Island, we showed that species distribution models trained using opportunistic observations submitted by hikers (citizen science) are comparable in quality and predictions to models trained using time- and cost-intensive field survey data [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, although large-scale avian citizen science platforms such as eBird may not adequately capture observations from alpine regions, localized and species-specific citizen science programs can provide valuable information about elusive alpine species such as VIWTP. Here, we build on our comparison of five modeling techniques using citizen science and field survey input data to investigate how climate change will alter the size, distribution, and configuration of suitable VIWTP breeding habitat. Specifically, we ask how the total amount, mean patch size and number of patches of suitable VIWTP habitat will change by the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s due to climate change. Our study identifies areas of highest vulnerability and guides future plans for conservation of this threatened subspecies, along with providing a baseline for future studies of connectivity for mountain wildlife across increasingly fragmented habitat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The ptarmigan banding work was approved by the UBC Animal Care Committee Protocol A01-0097. Birds were captured under the Canadian Federal Banding Sub Permit&#x02014;10365BO and BC Provincial banding permit (Water, Lands and Parks)&#x02014;C068541. Research was conducted in Strathcona Provincial Park under Park Use Permit&#x02014;#3081065.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area and species occurrence data</title><p>The study area encompassed all of Vancouver Island, located on the southwest coast of British Columbia, Canada (between 47&#x000b0; and 52&#x000b0; N latitude and 123&#x000b0; and 128&#x000b0; W longitude). At 460 km long (north to south) and 80 km wide (east to west; 32,134 km<sup>2</sup>), Vancouver Island is the largest island on the west coast of North America. Elevation varies from 0 to 2,195 m a.s.l. A central spine of mountains spans the length of the island, with highest elevations located in the center of the island within Strathcona Provincial Park (with four mountain summits between 1,830 m and 2,195 m). These mountains create a rain shadow on the eastern side, resulting in a strong east-west precipitation gradient across the island. The biogeography of the island has been classified into biogeoclimatic (BEC) zones by the provincial government that represent vegetation, soil, and climate conditions. Four BEC zones exist on Vancouver Island, including Coastal Douglas Fir, Coastal Western Hemlock, Mountain Hemlock and Coastal Mountain-heather Alpine. The largest areas of continuous alpine habitats are found in the central region of the island, while alpine patches in the northern and southern regions are generally lower in elevation and more fragmented.</p><p>We used two sources of distributional data for Vancouver Island White-tailed Ptarmigan. The first consisted of ptarmigan presence locations from field surveys conducted by K. Martin from 1995&#x02013;1999. These surveys targeted the entire range of VIWTP and representative alpine habitat deemed suitable for ptarmigan was searched in the north, central, and south island. Birds were located using playbacks of male territorial calls and chick distress calls, then captured with a snare attached to an extendable pole [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and outfitted with a necklace collar radio transmitter (RI-2D/2B, 18 mo battery life, weight 6&#x02013;9 gm, Holohil Systems Ltd., Carp, Ontario). K. Martin and field crews tracked the radio-collared birds over the 4-year period by foot during summer and recorded encounters with other uncollared birds using playbacks and incidental encounters. GPS coordinates were recorded at each bird location.</p><p>From this field survey dataset, we extracted summer (June&#x02013;October) observations and eliminated sightings of juveniles, since they were usually found at or near the same GPS coordinate as their parent during the summer period. We then eliminated duplicates at the same GPS point (i.e., if a flock of several birds was recorded at one point, only one observation was included in the final dataset). To minimize bias due to certain individuals being observed more than others, we first eliminated records from the same individual that were &#x0003c; 1 day apart, and then randomly selected two records per individual. Lastly, we randomly selected one observation within each 100-m grid cell of the environmental predictor GIS layers. All filtering of the original ptarmigan data was carried out using R 3.1.2.</p><p>In order to supplement the field survey records, an opportunistic citizen science program was initiated in partnership between the Strathcona Wilderness Institute and K. Martin at the Centre for Alpine Studies, University of British Columbia. Notices were posted at trailheads within Strathcona Provincial Park describing distinguishing features of White-tailed Ptarmigan. The notices requested that hikers report their ptarmigan sightings by mailing a card or sending an e-mail with GPS or map coordinates and photos (if possible) to K. Martin at UBC. The citizen science initiative began in 1995 and continues to the present, currently resulting in 404 confirmed White-tailed Ptarmigan sightings (see [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] for details). Although trailhead cards were posted within Strathcona Provincial Park, many hikers frequently submitted records from their other alpine hikes on the island after finding out about the program. This resulted in a public dataset spanning the entire range of alpine habitat on Vancouver Island (<xref rid="pone.0142110.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0142110.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0142110.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>White-tailed Ptarmigan presence locations on Vancouver Island from the field survey (circles; N = 207) and public submissions (triangles; N = 137).</title><p>Strathcona Provincial Park is outlined in black.

As with the field survey observations, we eliminated duplicates at the same location and randomly selected one observation within each 100-m grid cell. Because the field survey and public datasets result in models with similar accuracy and distributional predictions when using machine learning modeling techniques [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we combined ptarmigan presence locations from each dataset in order to maximize sample size and model accuracy for the purpose of this study. If two sightings fell within the same 100-m grid cell in the combined dataset, we randomly eliminated one sighting from the cell. The resulting combined dataset contained 344 sightings (207 from the field survey and 137 from the public dataset; <xref rid="pone.0142110.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>Because we lack information on ptarmigan absences (areas traversed by observers where ptarmigan were not encountered) in either dataset, we generated a baseline random sample of pseudo-absences for the combined dataset to represent the landscape potentially available to VIWTP. First, we constrained the pseudo-absence background within a 200-m buffer surrounding the minimum convex polygon around the entire set of ptarmigan observation points. Within this area, we restricted the background to areas within the Coastal Mountain-heather Alpine and Mountain Hemlock Biogeoclimatic (BEC) zones. The majority (92%) of ptarmigan presence locations fell within the Coastal Mountain-heather Alpine BEC zone, while the remainder fell within the Mountain Hemlock zone (except for one sighting in the Coastal Western Hemlock zone).</p><p>Some methods for generating pseudo-absences first predict low suitability areas using presence-only models and select pseudo-absences from those areas [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Senay et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] apply a novel three-step approach to select pseudo-absences using environmental constraints which can outperform models where pseudo-absences are randomly generated. We used distribution maps of BEC zones, which incorporate environmental variables known to be correlated with ptarmigan presence, to define environmental constraints for pseudo-absence selection. In contrast to methods that generate pseudo-absences outside of suitable habitat, we differentiated &#x02018;&#x02018;suitable&#x0201d; from &#x02018;&#x02018;highly suitable&#x0201d; habitat by generating pseudo-absences within potentially suitable habitat (which included both Mountain Hemlock and Coastal Mountain-heather Alpine zones). Such a distinction is important for rare and threatened species [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Including Mountain Hemlock zones in our pseudo-absence background also allowed for better discrimination between presence and absence locations.</p><p>Within this background, we excluded all areas within a 200-m buffer around known ptarmigan presence locations (the median distance moved by ptarmigan within a day during summer was 170 m based on the radio-telemetry study; N = 37 movements). Finally, we randomly selected twice as many pseudo-absence locations as the number of ptarmigan presence locations (688 total pseudo-absences). This choice was based on an initial exploration of different ratios of presences to pseudo-absences (1:2, 1:4, and 1:10) to check for changes in model accuracy measures (sensitivity, specificity, Kappa, AUC, and the True Skill Statistic). Using a ratio of 1:2 resulted in the highest Kappa value, whereas all other accuracy measures were not affected by presence-to-pseudo absence ratio.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Abiotic predictor variables</title><p>To model ptarmigan occurrence, we used eight abiotic variables believed to influence ptarmigan distribution (<xref rid="pone.0142110.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Five topographic variables included elevation, aspect, slope, compound topographic index (CTI, commonly referred to as a wetness index), and a vector ruggedness measure (VRM). All topographic variables were derived from a 100-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Aspect and slope were calculated using ArcGIS Spatial Analyst. We transformed aspect as x = -1*cos[&#x000d8;(&#x003c0;/180)], where &#x000d8; is the aspect measured in degrees.

The GCMs differed very little in their estimates of habitat loss and configuration, whereas greenhouse gas concentration scenarios depicted very different futures for VIWTP habitat. By the 2080s, we predict VIWTP will lose at least 53%, or as high as 77%, of their habitat under the low and high greenhouse gas scenarios, respectively. Our predictions are consistent with predictions of significant range contractions for other high elevation specialist species as a consequence of global climate change [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Warmer summers and reduced snowfall drive VIWTP range change</title><p>After elevation, mean summer temperature and precipitation as snow were the second and third most important variables for predicting VIWTP distributions. Changes in these climate variables will likely drive habitat loss. Increased annual mean summer temperature will likely correspond with increased frequency of extreme heat days, which may stress birds and lead to reduced fecundity or survival [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Warmer summers and reduced snowfall will also lead to the loss of permanent snow fields, which are important for ptarmigan thermoregulation and for providing sufficient moisture for ptarmigan forage [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Additionally, ptarmigan moult is primarily influenced by photoperiod and not climate [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. As the number of snow-free days during the year increase, birds with white plumage against a dark background may be at increased risk of predation, especially independent but naive juveniles. Birds may adapt to changing conditions through evolutionary changes in their molt response to photoperiod and increased ability to tolerate heat, but such selective responses are likely to be slow [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Climate change greatly impacts spatial configuration of VIWTP habitat</title><p>While many studies project future range shifts for wildlife, the spatial configuration and connectivity of future habitats has been less well addressed. Our work predicts that VIWTP habitat will become increasingly fragmented and confined to mountaintops. Climate change will likely cause fragmentation of VIWTP habitat by facilitating infilling of trees and shrubs into previously open alpine tundra [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], a process already documented at high elevations on Vancouver Island [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The effects of habitat fragmentation on VIWTP persistence will depend on their home range size and dispersal ability. Substantial movement of VIWTP genes occurs across the landscape and high allelic richness is found even among the most isolated populations [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Female White-tailed Ptarmigan in Colorado can move long distances to other breeding areas without incurring reproductive or survival costs during the breeding season [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These studies suggest that ptarmigan may be able to persist on Vancouver Island despite increasing habitat fragmentation due to their apparent ability to move between patches, at least for the initial periods of change. Still, our results predict the disappearance of nearly all of the ptarmigan habitat south of Strathcona Provincial Park by the 2080s. Large areas of unsuitable low elevation habitat act as a barrier to VIWTP gene flow, as the southern populations appeared to be smaller and more temporally variable [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Thus, these southern populations may well be extirpated by climate-induced habitat loss within 70 years. The ability of ptarmigan to disperse between smaller and more spatially fragmented habitat patches will be an important predictor of VIWTP long-term viability, and future research should examine VIWTP dispersal distance as a function of future climates in order to inform management and conservation of the subspecies.</p><p>Under all climate change scenarios, our results predict substantial decline in the average suitable patch size for VIWTP by the 2080s, including loss of most large patches and an increasing number of very small patches. Although average patch size is predicted to decline gradually from the 2020s&#x02013;2080s, total number of patches is predicted to decline by the 2020s but then increase in the 2050s and 2080s. The predicted reduction in number of patches by the 2020s primarily reflects the disappearance of most very small patches of currently suitable habitat. By the 2080s, however, most current larger patches are predicted to become fragmented into several smaller patches, increasing the total number of patches but lowering average patch size. As shown by [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], there is likely a demographic cost for VIWTP persisting in smaller patches. Alpine habitat already exists as small, fragmented &#x0201c;sky islands&#x0201d; on Vancouver Island compared to interior alpine, which is more continuous. Further fragmentation and reduction in patch size of VIWTP habitat will likely be detrimental to ptarmigan breeding success [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and may also hinder dispersal and increase the ecological cost of movement, as birds will increasingly be forced to cross unsuitable habitat in order to reach suitable breeding patches. Finally, the average elevation of suitable habitat patches is expected to increase by the 2080s, reflecting a loss of patches at lower elevations. Thus ptarmigan are in danger of being &#x0201c;squeezed off the mountain&#x0201d;, as their remaining suitable habitat will be increasingly confined to mountaintops.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Implications for VIWTP population persistence and the importance of refugia</title><p>The configuration of future habitat is important when modeling shifts in climate envelopes in part because of the importance of micro- and macrorefugia in allowing the persistence of populations. VIWTP may show resilience to climate change-induced habitat loss through the use of microrefugia. Microrefugia differ from macrorefugia in that they are small areas with unusual microclimates that allow species to persist in areas that might be deemed unsuitable according to average background climates [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Coarse scale species distribution models tend to overestimate extinction risk because they use climate grids that are too coarse to predict locations of fine-scale topographic relief that may provide microrefugia [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Although we used a smaller climate grid (100 m) than many species distribution modeling studies, we acknowledge that we can still only identify climate macrorefugia. Randin <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] found that local-scale models (25 m grid cells) predicted some persistence of suitable habitats at high elevations for European plant species that were predicted to lose all of their suitable habitat according to large-scale models (10&#x02032; grid cells). Similarly, ptarmigan may be able to utilize microclimates created by fine-scale landscape features (e.g., boulders, ravines, and water bodies), vegetation type, or small variations in slope or aspect not accounted for in our models to persist in habitat that is predicted to be lost (see [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]). In contrast, Trivedi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] found that coarse scale models overestimated species thermal tolerances and underestimated the potential impact of climate change on high elevation species compared to local-scale models, suggesting that microclimatic refugia may not allow for persistence as speculated.</p><p>Even if ptarmigan can utilize microrefugia, it is unlikely that populations will be able to persist in their current numbers. Extinction probability increases with reduced range size and connectivity [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and climate change will increase the variability of extreme temperatures and weather events in high elevation habitats [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Ptarmigan must be able to live and reproduce through these extreme episodes if they are to persist. Alpine birds tend to exhibit slower life histories than low elevation populations of the same or similar species, where high elevation individuals have the lowest breeding success but higher survival [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. More frequent episodes of extreme conditions may alter the fitness consequences of alternative life-history strategies and exceed the coping abilities of alpine-breeding birds.</p><p>The persistence of populations in the central and northern regions of Vancouver Island will depend partially on the ability of birds to utilize smaller areas at higher densities. Alpine ibex (<italic>Capra ibex</italic>) have shown intensified density dependence under unfavourable climatic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], which also may be the case for ptarmigan especially if the quality of &#x0201c;suitable&#x0201d; habitat declines. For instance, ptarmigan may encounter more competition from lower elevation competitors such as Sooty Grouse (<italic>Dendragapus fuliginosus</italic>) and increased predation pressure from generalist predators such as ravens, particularly around nest sites [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This potential replacement of an alpine specialist with generalist competitors and increased predators corresponds to recent findings in Europe, where local species assemblages are increasingly composed of native habitat generalists [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Strengths and limitations of climate envelope models</title><p>The choice of a threshold for determining habitat suitability with species distribution models can be subjective, especially when reliable absence data are not available [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. We used a threshold that maximized sensitivity (set at 0.90) to correctly predict the largest number of ptarmigan presence locations while attempting to avoid overpredicting habitat suitability across the landscape by setting sensitivity too high. However, as in most studies of this kind, we cannot be sure that areas without ptarmigan sightings represent unsuitable summer habitat. A series of initial trials revealed that our choice of threshold and resulting estimates of habitat loss were conservative; other methodological choices for setting a threshold, such as maximizing model accuracy according to kappa or setting a lower sensitivity, resulted in smaller estimates of suitable habitat area and greater predictions for climate-induced habitat loss. By utilizing a threshold that slightly over-predicts baseline suitable habitat for VIWTP, we minimized the chances of &#x0201c;missing&#x0201d; areas of suitable habitat and overestimating habitat loss as often occurs in climate envelope studies [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].</p><p>Although their shortcomings have been described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], predictions from climate envelope models have corresponded well with observed population trends for breeding birds [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] and range shifts for montane birds [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Climate envelope models can also be useful for identifying conservation opportunities within climatic macro-refugia or newly available habitat [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Our predictions for VIWTP appear realistic based on predictions for loss of alpine tundra in British Columbia [<xref rid="pone.0142110.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and allow for informed decisions for prioritizing management of areas where ptarmigan are likely to persist.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Changes in the configuration of alpine habitat, including fragmentation and increasing confinement to high elevation mountaintops, will likely play a large role in driving the responses of alpine wildlife to climate change. VIWTP, along with other alpine specialists, are in danger of being &#x0201c;squeezed off the mountain&#x0201d; as alpine habitat declines in total area and mean patch size. Our results also emphasize that regardless of changes in habitat size and connectivity and the threshold chosen to define &#x0201c;suitable&#x0201d; ptarmigan habitat, habitat quality will be reduced from the birds&#x02019; point of view. This reduction in quality may manifest in several ways including physiological intolerance to warming, reduced survival or brood failure due to increased frequency of extreme weather events, lower food availability, and/or increased competition or predation. Little is known about the potential fate of North America&#x02019;s coastal alpine ecosystems under climate change or the ability of alpine animals to cope with deteriorating habitat quality. Because our study has implications for other high elevation specialist species with similarly restricted ranges, White-tailed Ptarmigan can be considered an indicator species for coastal alpine ecosystems in the face of climate change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142110.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Mean decrease in Gini Index.</title><p>The mean decrease in the Gini index as a measure of variable importance for predictor variables from the Random Forest model for predicting presence of White-tailed Ptarmigan on Vancouver Island.
