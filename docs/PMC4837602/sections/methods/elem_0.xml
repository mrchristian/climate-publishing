  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 2007 to 2014, we equipped 96 caribou (80 F, 16 M) from the RAF herd with GPS telemetry collars (Telonics, Mesa, AZ, USA; precision ≤20 m). The sample size was relatively modest at the onset of our study with seven individuals monitored in 2007 but increased consistently to reach 70 individuals monitored simultaneously in 2014, for a total of 181 individual-years (see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> for more details). On average, we monitored 23 ± 8 SE (standard error) individuals each year, and individuals were monitored for 1.9 ± 0.1 SE years (up to six consecutive years). We captured caribou during winter using a net-gun fired from a helicopter. Capture procedures were approved by Animal Welfare Committees of the Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs du Québec and Université Laval (#2008-015 and 2011–039; certificates renewed each year). We programmed collars to record a location every 1, 2, 7, 11, or 13 h (every 4.2 ± &lt;0.1 h, on average) depending on the period and collar model. For the purposes of a companion study [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>], the frequencies of GPS locations were higher during migrations (from April to May for the spring migration and from October to December for the fall migration) and lower during summer and winter periods. We considered this variability in location frequency by accounting for time between successive locations in the analyses.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess fine-scale responses of caribou to the availability of ice on water bodies, we restricted our study to the vicinity of the largest lakes, rivers, and reservoirs in the study area. We used caribou monitoring data and digital hydrological maps to isolate large lakes that were susceptible to influence caribou behaviour. We selected only the largest water bodies (average of 1 475 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>, see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>) that were crossed by collared caribou during 2007–2014 because they could represent semipermeable barriers to caribou movements and induce locomotion costs. We also selected the largest lakes to ensure that crossing events were accurate, and not artefacts caused by the uncertainty of caribou trajectories between successive GPS locations.

Other features (i.e., land, snow, and clouds) were assigned a null value. This equation generated values ranging between −1.0 (i.e., open water) and 1.0 (i.e., completely frozen). We plotted this index across years (Fig.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We isolated GPS locations on the surface, as well as within 5-km buffer zones around the largest water bodies. We used these buffer zones to keep every location of individuals that reached the vicinity and either crossed or circumvented water bodies. We examined each sequence of successive locations (hereafter segments) to identify movements across surfaces (hereafter crossings) or around the periphery of lakes and rivers (hereafter detours). We were specifically interested in isolating the respective influence of ice, water, and land in facilitating or hindering caribou movements. We removed groups of successive clumped locations on land or islands (i.e., stopovers

We also tested whether their relative frequency was explained by the availability of ice, by comparing years with early and late freezing dates using a Welch

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We discriminated movement segments (i.e., crossings and detours) using a minimum of three successive locations to allow the calculation of turning angles. We estimated turning angles (°) by measuring the angle between the first and second steps (i.e., steps are straight lines between successive locations) composing a segment. For segments longer than two steps, we calculated the mean turning angle across the whole segment. We also estimated the mean movement rate (m/h) across segments by averaging the Euclidian distance travelled between successive locations divided by the time the animal took to complete the step. Movement rates and turning angles were estimated using the 
   <span class="italic">adehabitatLT</span> package in R [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. We compared movement metrics of caribou on ice (

   <span class="italic">n</span> = 139 locations, 9 individuals), and during detours (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the fine-scale availability of ice for caribou, we generated 1- and 2.5-km buffer zones around each location and evaluated the proportion of ice and water surrounding each location using the Geospatial Modelling Environment software [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. These buffer zone sizes encompassed frequently reported zones of influence for 
   <span class="italic">Rangifer</span> (e.g., [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]). We then compared the composition of buffer zones using Welch 
   <span class="italic">t</span> tests for crossings on ice, in water, and detours separately. Similar results were obtained using the 1- and 2.5-km buffer zones; thus, we only discuss results obtained using the 1-km buffer zone.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the selection of ice and water by caribou, we performed a step selection function (SSF) using the 
   <span class="italic">survival</span> package in R [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. SSFs compare observed steps to random steps originating from the same location in a conditional regression framework [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. We chose this method because the availability of ice and water needed to be measured in areas immediately available to individuals [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. We paired observed steps to 10 random steps drawn from the frequency distributions of lengths and turning angles of each individual at each location frequency. Prior to estimating frequency distributions of step lengths, we removed the highest 5 % outlier distances to prevent generating overly long random steps [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. The conditional regression evaluated the probability of observing a real step with varying proportions of ice and water along each step. Although many environmental variables other than water and ice availability drive fine-scale movements of ungulates [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>], we refrained from complexifying models to specifically test our hypothesis that caribou avoided water and selected ice during step selection.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the influence of water body type (natural lake, river, or hydroelectric reservoir) in a separate model, by testing the interaction between water body type and the proportion of both ice and water along each step. We used a model composed of interactions with a 3-level water body type factor, but simpler dichotomies (i.e., natural lakes and rivers vs. reservoirs, lakes and reservoirs vs. rivers) gave similar results and are not shown.

Year could not be included as a single covariate in a global SSF model, because conditional regressions compare strata at the scale of a step (i.e., always intra-annual). We also grouped years based on ice availability, isolating years with a short ice-availability period from years with a long ice-availability period, and used this dichotomy to evaluate separate SSF models. Year 2014 was not included in these analyses because caribou monitoring ended in summer 2014, before the freezing of water bodies.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the potential consequences of climate change for migratory caribou by simulating future changes in ice phenology in our study area. For each year with caribou data (2007 – 2014), we advanced the average breakup date of the largest water bodies by 1-day increments, up to a 30-day change. We performed the same simulations in fall by delaying the average freeze date by 1-day increments for 30 days. At each increment, we determined the proportion of ice crossings that would not have been possible if breakup had been advanced or freezing had been delayed by 1 day. We then compared these simulations to various lake-ice cover projections made across North America [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. All projections were based on the high-emission A2 scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the “business-as-usual” scenario [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]), but differed in their general circulation models. We calculated the mean predicted change in date for each projection (studies often reported a range of potential values or results from multiple climate models) and compared these values to our simulations. We used these projections to describe the potential availability of ice for caribou in our study area 25 – 50 years from now, i.e., in 2041–2070.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using these projections and our monitoring data, we estimated the additional distance required to circumvent water bodies in the future by isolating all ice crossings that would have become impossible (due to the absence of ice) and replacing them with simulated detours around water bodies. To do so, we simply isolated the first and last locations of ice crossings and generated new paths around water bodies, using the shortest route possible. We then compared the distance travelled by caribou during our study to the predicted distance obtained under potential future climate conditions. We compared distances between segments using paired 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-test and report the total difference in distance during the whole study. We did not generate detours from segments across rivers or leading to islands because finding an alternate route was often impossible.
