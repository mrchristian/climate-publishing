  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 181 individual-years monitored, 95 (52 individuals) used the vicinity (i.e., surfaces and 5-km buffer zones) of the largest water bodies in the study area. These individuals performed 179 ice crossings, 11 water crossings, and 129 detours. The longest crossing was recorded on reservoir Robert-Bourassa, when a caribou walked on ice for ~30 h over a &gt;60 km distance. The caribou with the longest swimming distance swam across Lake Bienville over a &gt;25 km distance. Based on MODIS maps, ice was completely unavailable during this crossing, which occurred on October 19
   <span class="sup">th</span> ˗ 21
   <span class="sup">st</span>, 2013. All water crossings occurred during the fall migration (i.e., between 16 September and 29 November), and most of them occurred on the northernmost lakes (i.e., Clearwater and Bienville). The frequency of water crossings did not change with time (
   <span class="italic">F</span> = 1.98, df = 5, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.22) or between years with early (2007–2008, and 2013) and late freezing (2009–2012; 
   <span class="italic">t</span> = −0.95, df = 3.59, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.40). During 5 of the 11 water crossings, caribou began crossing in water but eventually got out and went around instead (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Many individuals made long “pauses” before or after crossing or circumventing water bodies (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). No collared caribou died on or in the vicinity of water bodies during our study.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By examining the composition of 1-km buffer zones around caribou locations in the vicinity of water bodies, we determined that caribou tended to use ice when it was available: locations on ice were surrounded at 61.1 ± 1.7 % SE by ice and at 4.6 ± 0.7 % SE by water, on average (
   <span class="italic">t</span> = 30.8, df = 476, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01). When ice was not available, caribou used water, which occupied 62.4 ± 3.5 % SE of the area surrounding water-crossing locations, against 18.4 ± 3.2 % SE for ice (
   <span class="italic">t</span> = −9.3, df = 178, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01). Caribou made detours even when ice was available (i.e., the area surrounding detours was composed at 48.4 ± 2.3 % SE by ice and at 10.5 ± 1.6 % SE by water); however, proportions of ice and water surrounding detours differed significantly from movements across ice (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01), suggesting that caribou made more detours when ice was less available.

Significant effects (i.e., selection for ice and avoidance of water) were uniform across years and for years with short (2010–2012) and long ice-availability windows (2007–2009 and 2013). Avoidance of water was significant during years with a long ice-availability period, and selection for ice was significant during years with a short ice-availability period (Table

   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>). When we delayed the average freezing date to projected values for the 2041–2070 horizon (delays of 7.8–13.8 days), the proportion of impossible ice crossings during the fall migration reached 24–46 % (12 to 23/50, Fig.
