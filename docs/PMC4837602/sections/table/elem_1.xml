  <p>Results from annual step selection function models. We present the parameter estimates (β) ± standard errors (SE) and 
   <span class="italic">P</span> values of covariates included in annual step selection function (SSF) models explaining the crossings and detours of migratory caribou from the Rivière-aux-Feuilles herd in the vicinity of the largest lakes in Northern Québec, Canada, from 2007 to 2013. Separate SSF models were also performed based on ice availability, isolating years with short (2010–2012) and long ice-availability periods (2007–2009, 2013)
