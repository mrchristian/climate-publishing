 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a consequence of a warming Arctic, caribou may encounter unfrozen lakes more frequently during their migrations. Ongoing research [M. Le Corre, C. Dussault, and S. D. Côté, unpublished observations] reveals that caribou in Northern Québec are initiating their spring and fall migrations earlier. This response may allow caribou to avoid a potential mismatch between the timing of migration and freshwater ice availability. Assuming caribou are unable to adjust the timing of their migrations further (e.g., see [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]), delays in ice phenology could force caribou to cross water bodies more frequently in open water or across ice too thin to bear their weight, causing increased risks of drowning [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. Changes in ice phenology could also lead caribou to circumvent water bodies for several km, with possible negative consequences on their energy reserves. Considering that caribou rarely swam across unfrozen water bodies and frequently circumvented lakes for several km when ice was unavailable, the latter consequence seems likely.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caribou in Northern Québec seemed to favour ice substrates during migrations and winter displacements. Their movements in water were slower and more sinuous than their movements on ice. The relatively long “pauses” caribou often made on lake shores could have allowed them to assess the quality (i.e., thickness) of the ice before crossing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. Caribou may also have used these “pauses” to feed and rest before or after crossing barren ice surfaces. Caribou made long excursions over frozen lakes, with the longest crossings exceeding 60 km. Reports of long journeys across ice by caribou and reindeer are not without precedent. Miller et al. ([
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>] and references therein) described observations of reindeer walking on ice for several hundreds of km, including a 380 km trip by one individual over the Barents Sea. These authors also observed reindeer remaining on ice for &gt;25 km after land was easily accessible, suggesting that long trips across ice were not stressful for them. Based on the limited information about caribou swimming in the scientific literature, the longest water crossing we recorded was the longest ever reported (&gt;25 km vs. 3–10 km [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]). We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that the individual that performed this water crossing used islands smaller than the minimum resolution of digital maps (i.e., 500 m) as stopover sites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caribou swim at the water surface using quadrupedal paddling, which is amongst the least efficient types of swim in vertebrates [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. Few comparative data exist for running and swimming energetics in fully-terrestrial mammals. Mink (
  <span class="italic">Neovison vison</span>) spend 2.7 times more energy swimming compared to running [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>]. To cover a given distance, humans spend approximately four times more energy in water than on land, and go half as fast [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>]. It is probable that the comparative costs of swimming vs. running for caribou are similar to those of humans, if not higher, due to the low propulsive surface area of their finer limbs. Thus, the avoidance of water and selection of ice by caribou could be largely explained by locomotion energetics.
