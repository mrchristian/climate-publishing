 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 2007 to 2014, we equipped 96 caribou (80 F, 16 M) from the RAF herd with GPS telemetry collars (Telonics, Mesa, AZ, USA; precision ≤20 m). The sample size was relatively modest at the onset of our study with seven individuals monitored in 2007 but increased consistently to reach 70 individuals monitored simultaneously in 2014, for a total of 181 individual-years (see Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> for more details). On average, we monitored 23 ± 8 SE (standard error) individuals each year, and individuals were monitored for 1.9 ± 0.1 SE years (up to six consecutive years). We captured caribou during winter using a net-gun fired from a helicopter. Capture procedures were approved by Animal Welfare Committees of the Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs du Québec and Université Laval (#2008-015 and 2011–039; certificates renewed each year). We programmed collars to record a location every 1, 2, 7, 11, or 13 h (every 4.2 ± &lt;0.1 h, on average) depending on the period and collar model. For the purposes of a companion study [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>], the frequencies of GPS locations were higher during migrations (from April to May for the spring migration and from October to December for the fall migration) and lower during summer and winter periods. We considered this variability in location frequency by accounting for time between successive locations in the analyses.
