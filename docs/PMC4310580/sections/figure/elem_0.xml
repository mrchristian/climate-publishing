  <p>Genomic tools that can add to capacity for understanding risk and monitoring management actions at each stage of the invasion process. Tools can assist in the initial detection of an invasion, monitoring its spread after the initial detection and understanding the potential for invasions to expand and impact native species following evolutionary adaptation. Management priorities and questions relevant to each stage are also shown.</p>
