   <span class="italic">Anas platyrhynchos</span> (Huang et al.

   <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> species such as 
   <span class="italic">D. melanogaster</span> and

   <a rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58">2010</a>). Some of these species are useful for climatic studies, based on evidence for geographic variation in climate responses in species such as the drosophilids (Hoffmann et al.

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many genomic approaches can be applied to population genetic studies of nonmodel species that lack a reference genome assembly. The use of sequence tagging and ‘Pool-Seq’ technologies, together with relatively inexpensive RNA-Seq, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and other reduced-representation library methods, means that data on many thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be collected at moderate cost on multiple samples from a population without a reference genome (Box 
   <a ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1" href="#bx1">1</a>) (e.g. Hohenlohe et al. 
   <a rid="b141" ref-type="bibr" href="#b141">2010</a>; Elshire et al. 
   <a rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" href="#b98">2011</a>; Bi et al. 
   <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2013</a>; Neves et al. 
   <a rid="b206" ref-type="bibr" href="#b206">2013</a>; Yeaman et al. 
   <a rid="b324" ref-type="bibr" href="#b324">2014</a>). However, even draft reference genomes or genomes from related species can be useful when implementing these approaches to identify variants. The expansion of reference genomes across a wider array of species will facilitate the study of invasion genomics. Several impediments to genome construction still exist (Ellegren 
   <a rid="b95" ref-type="bibr" href="#b95">2014</a>), although new technologies are emerging to overcome them and the cost of short-read sequencing is declining. Nonetheless, many plants and animals have large genomes, and the common occurrence of higher ploidy, especially in invasive plants, adds significant difficulty and expense. Higher ploidy also complicates other approaches such as SNP identification and analyses (see below).

    <p>Whole-genome resequencing is cost-prohibitive and unnecessary in many cases. As an alternative, several methods of genome reduction make it possible for many individuals to be combined in one sequencing run while maintaining high coverage. This results in the reliable identification of SNPs and genotypes for each individual at a subset of regions throughout the genome.</p>
    <p>Restriction-enzyme-based reduced-representation sequencing: Genomic DNA is digested with specific restriction enzymes, followed by ligation of adaptors, amplification and sequencing. Several methods employ this strategy, including genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS; Elshire et al. 
     <a rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" href="#b98">2011</a>) and RAD-Seq (Hohenlohe et al. 
     <a rid="b141" ref-type="bibr" href="#b141">2010</a>). Repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided using methylation-sensitive enzymes (Elshire et al. 
     <a rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" href="#b98">2011</a>). This approach is relatively inexpensive and easy to use in nonmodel organisms, but can suffer from biases such as those associated with the loss of restriction sites in some individuals (Gautier et al. 
     <a rid="b119" ref-type="bibr" href="#b119">2013</a>).
    </p>
    <p>RNA-Seq: Sequencing mRNA from the genes that are expressed in the whole organism or specific sampled tissues at a particular point in time and development and under specific conditions (the ‘transcriptome’ of a whole organism or specific tissue; Wang et al. 
     <a rid="b309" ref-type="bibr" href="#b309">2009</a>). This method targets the expressed portion of the genome (protein-coding sequences and untranslated regions of genes). Gene expression and sequence information is simultaneously identified, as it is possible to compare counts of reads that map to genes and identify variants given sufficient expression of that gene in each individual.
    </p>
    <p>Targeted sequence capture by hybridization: This approach uses oligoprobes to enrich specific regions of the genome for subsequent next-generation sequencing. The scale of the capture can range from a handful to several thousand targeted loci, making it appropriate for wide range of projects. However, prior genomic knowledge is essential for the development of the probes (e.g. through RAD-Seq or RNA-Seq projects). The development of noncommercial protocols and PCR-based probes (Peñalba et al. 
     <a rid="b214" ref-type="bibr" href="#b214">2014</a>) is making this approach more attractive for smaller-scale sequencing projects in nonmodel species. Several alternative methods are available that enrich target regions prior to sequencing (for review, see Mamanova et al. 
     <a rid="b183" ref-type="bibr" href="#b183">2010</a>).
    </p>
    <p>Gene-space sequencing: Many genomes are replete with repetitive regions along with genes present in high copy number (e.g. chloroplast genes), and whole-genome sequencing without reducing their quantity can be a substantial waste of sequencing space. Consequently, some approaches seek to deplete these regions rather than enrich specific portions of the genome (e.g. Matvienko et al. 
     <a rid="b187" ref-type="bibr" href="#b187">2013</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important feature of invasive species for evolutionary studies is that the introduction and spread of the invader is often documented (Baker 
   <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">1974</a>), and in many cases, this includes historic collections. Genomic studies are benefiting from increased progress in obtaining information from specimens stored in herbariums, museum collections or recovered from natural repositories such as sediment layers in lake bottoms (Krehenwinkel and Tautz 
   <a rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b160">2013</a>; Martin et al. 
   <a rid="b185" ref-type="bibr" href="#b185">2014</a>). Such studies are particularly applicable to invasive organisms that are often represented well in collections with longitudinal sampling. These specimen records often cover periods over which populations have been exposed to relatively rapid climate change (such as between 1970 and 2000) (Hansen et al. 
   <a rid="b132" ref-type="bibr" href="#b132">2013</a>). More formal approaches are also now being applied to secure the preservation of material across time, such as the resurrection initiative for plants (Franks et al. 
   <a rid="b109" ref-type="bibr" href="#b109">2008</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In future, methods can be employed that maximize the genomic information obtained from such limited material, rather than focusing on a few anonymous markers. Whole-genome resequencing has been used successfully for historic samples (Rowe et al. 
   <a rid="b250" ref-type="bibr" href="#b250">2011</a>), although contamination by nontarget DNA can make this expensive proposition even more cost-prohibitive. Sequence capture, which utilizes probes to enrich target sequences (e.g. Bi et al. 
   <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2013</a>) (Box 
   <a ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1" href="#bx1">1</a>), offers a compromise between minimizing sequencing costs and maximizing sequence information from target regions of the study organism. Pooling individual samples together prior to either whole-genome (e.g. Futschik and Schlotterer 
   <a rid="b112" ref-type="bibr" href="#b112">2010</a>) or reduced-representation (e.g. Vandepitte et al. 
   <a rid="b303" ref-type="bibr" href="#b303">2012</a>) sequencing is another approach that can greatly reduce costs, while still providing useful information about the genomic extent and location of variation and divergence. Genome-wide analysis of historic DNA in invasive species will provide exciting opportunities to assess the temporal dynamics of evolutionary change during colonization and spread, and over periods of rapid climate change. It can also provide evidence of past changes in population size across time through coalescence methods (do Amaral et al. 
   <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">2013</a>) and indicate parts of the genome that have been affected by selection and population processes (Excoffier et al. 
   <a rid="b101" ref-type="bibr" href="#b101">2009</a>). Such data will improve inference of invasion history and aid in the identification of the genetic basis of recent adaptation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Top-down and bottom-up approaches</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecological and landscape genomics are approaches that incorporate information about the phenotype, genotype and the local environment to make inferences about the loci involved in local adaptation. ‘Bottom-up’ approaches use the genomic signatures of selection to identify loci likely important for adaptation and do not rely on phenotypic information (Wright and Gaut 
   <a rid="b320" ref-type="bibr" href="#b320">2005</a>). Several different methods are used, such as tests examining the site frequency spectrum or the extent of linkage disequilibrium, which can indicate the location of a recent selective sweep (Smith and Haigh 
   <a rid="b269" ref-type="bibr" href="#b269">2007</a>; Thornton et al. 
   <a rid="b293" ref-type="bibr" href="#b293">2007</a>). The popular 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>ST</sub> outlier method identifies regions of the genome under divergent selection by determining which sites have strong differentiation among populations relative to the entire genome or a set of putatively neutrally evolving loci (Lewontin and Krakauer 
   <a rid="b176" ref-type="bibr" href="#b176">1973</a>; Beaumont and Nichols 
   <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">1996</a>; Foll and Gaggiotti 
   <a rid="b105" ref-type="bibr" href="#b105">2008</a>; Steane et al. 
   <a rid="b275" ref-type="bibr" href="#b275">2014</a>). Another approach involves identifying associations between alleles and the local environment, while controlling for population structure, to make inferences about local adaptation (e.g. Coop et al. 
   <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">2010</a>; Günther and Coop 
   <a rid="b128" ref-type="bibr" href="#b128">2013</a>). Many of these tests of selection could be applied to invasive species to identify the genes associated with adaptation during invasion and in responses to climate change. These methods are appealing because genes under selection during invasion can be identified without 
   <span class="italic">a priori</span> identification of specific functional traits and do not require common garden experiments. However, the loci identified may only be in linkage disequilibrium with the functional site(s). Moreover, population structure can hinder the ability of these tests to correctly identify adaptive loci, and certain demographic scenarios, particularly those involving nonequilibrium conditions, have been shown to generate a large number of false positives (Lotterhos and Whitlock 
   <a rid="b180" ref-type="bibr" href="#b180">2014</a>). A critical assessment of how complicated invasion histories, including founder events and genetic admixture, might impact the ability of these methods to detect loci under very recent divergent selection has not yet been conducted, but these processes could represent an impediment to the successful implementation of these tests in some invasive species.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Top-down’ methods offer a complementary approach for identifying the genetic basis of adaptation (Wright and Gaut 
   <a rid="b320" ref-type="bibr" href="#b320">2005</a>; Barrett and Hoekstra 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2011</a>). Here, the genetic basis of specific traits under selection during invasion can be dissected by looking for the cosegregation of these traits and genetic markers. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping uses pedigreed populations descended from known parents. Linkage disequilibrium between genetic markers and causal loci enables the identification of genomic regions segregating with the phenotypes of interest. This method limits the identification of loci to those present in the initial cross, and the genomic resolution is low due to high linkage disequilibrium in the mapping population. Association mapping studies use unpedigreed mapping to look for associations between traits and markers, either using a candidate gene approach or genome-wide markers (GWAS studies) (Box 
   <a ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1" href="#bx1">1</a>). Such studies can be prone to false positives through spurious associations brought about by population structure, although there are statistical means to control for these effects (Tian et al. 
   <a rid="b294" ref-type="bibr" href="#b294">2008</a>). The approaches offer greater resolution than QTL studies due to the lower linkage disequilibrium found in natural populations relative to pedigreed mapping populations.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Top-down and bottom-up approaches each have their own advantages and disadvantages (Wright and Gaut 
   <a rid="b320" ref-type="bibr" href="#b320">2005</a>; Barrett and Hoekstra 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2011</a>; Le Corre and Kremer 
   <a rid="b167" ref-type="bibr" href="#b167">2012</a>; Sork et al. 
   <a rid="b272" ref-type="bibr" href="#b272">2013</a>), suggesting that tackling the problem from both ends will often yield the most useful results. However, there are biases common to all these methods that may obscure the genetic architecture of adaptation during invasion, or to climate change signals (Moran and Alexander 
   <a rid="b201" ref-type="bibr" href="#b201">2014</a>). For example, detecting small effect loci underlying polygenic traits has been a major challenge regardless of the method applied (Pritchard et al. 
   <a rid="b226" ref-type="bibr" href="#b226">2010</a>; Le Corre and Kremer 
   <a rid="b167" ref-type="bibr" href="#b167">2012</a>). Well-powered QTL and GWAS studies appear to be an effective solution to this problem (Bloom et al. 
   <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2013</a>), and new analytical methods that attempt to integrate information from GWAS with allele frequency data from many populations are providing a powerful way to identify the signal of local adaptation in polygenic traits (Turchin et al. 
   <a rid="b297" ref-type="bibr" href="#b297">2012</a>; Berg and Coop 
   <a rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27">2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although there have been few studies that have applied these approaches to identify genes important for adaptation during invasion, the growth of genomic data in nonmodel organisms suggest that these methods will soon be commonplace for invasive species. As strong selection will be required to see evolutionary changes over short time scales, theory suggests that large-effect loci (Yeaman and Whitlock 
   <a rid="b323" ref-type="bibr" href="#b323">2011</a>) or perhaps clusters of adaptive loci may be more likely to underlie a rapid response to selection. However, genetic changes from standing variation as opposed to new mutations are likely to be essential for adaptation during invasion, due to the waiting time required for new mutations (Barrett and Schluter 
   <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2008</a>; Prentis et al. 
   <a rid="b225" ref-type="bibr" href="#b225">2008</a>). This suggests that polygenic adaptation from standing variation present in the original introduction is likely, so adaptation through multiple loci of small effect may also play an important role in the invasion. Both empirical and theoretical studies are needed to determine which features of the genetic architecture of rapid adaptation, if any, might distinguish it from longer-term adaptive evolution and if differences in genetic architecture could impact the propensity of organisms to become invasive and/or rapidly adapt to continuing climate change.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The identification of candidate ‘invasion’ genes using these top-down and bottom-up approaches is only the first step. Comparisons across species will be essential for determining whether there are similar functional groups, genes or genetic pathways that frequently evolve during invasion and in responses to changing environments further precipitated by local climate change. This might be expected, for example, if invading species commonly evolve along similar fitness trade-offs in response to changes in the biotic and abiotic environment in the introduced range (Blossey and Notzold 
   <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">1995</a>; Bossdorf et al. 
   <a rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" href="#b39">2005</a>; He et al. 
   <a rid="b133" ref-type="bibr" href="#b133">2010</a>). The context dependence and sometimes idiosyncratic nature of invasion and adaptation may, however, make such generalities unlikely (though see also Richardson and Pyšek 
   <a rid="b238" ref-type="bibr" href="#b238">2006</a>, 
   <a rid="b239" ref-type="bibr" href="#b239">2012</a>). Experimental studies, where possible, will be important to assess fitness effects of these candidate loci in nature, while controlling for genetic background (Barrett and Hoekstra 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2011</a>). The development of more model invasive species amenable to reverse genetics will be key for dissecting the functional role of candidate loci and will be a step forward for invasion genomics (Stewart et al. 
   <a rid="b276" ref-type="bibr" href="#b276">2009</a>).
