 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multiple founders can facilitate population establishment in two ways. First, propagule pressure mitigates the impact of demographic stochasticity; second, increased genetic and phenotypic variation improves the chances of successful colonization (Colautti et al. 
  <a rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" href="#b68">2006</a>; Simberloff 
  <a rid="b266" ref-type="bibr" href="#b266">2009</a>; Rius and Darling 
  <a rid="b245" ref-type="bibr" href="#b245">2014</a>). A recent meta-analysis, which controlled for the effects of population size, found strong evidence that higher levels of genotypic and phenotypic diversity in founder groups increased establishment success (Forsman 
  <a rid="b107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b107">2014</a>). Genetic variation can improve the likelihood of establishment for many reasons (Zhu et al. 
  <a rid="b334" ref-type="bibr" href="#b334">2000</a>; Willi et al. 
  <a rid="b317" ref-type="bibr" href="#b317">2006</a>; Gamfeldt and Källström 
  <a rid="b113" ref-type="bibr" href="#b113">2007</a>; Dlugosch and Parker 
  <a rid="b88" ref-type="bibr" href="#b88">2008</a>; Prentis et al. 
  <a rid="b225" ref-type="bibr" href="#b225">2008</a>; Thompson et al. 
  <a rid="b292" ref-type="bibr" href="#b292">2012</a>; Berthouly-Salazar et al. 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2013</a>), and evidence is mounting that a large proportion of invasive species have experienced multiple introductions (e.g. Bossdorf et al. 
  <a rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" href="#b39">2005</a>; Roman and Darling 
  <a rid="b249" ref-type="bibr" href="#b249">2007</a>; Thompson et al. 
  <a rid="b292" ref-type="bibr" href="#b292">2012</a>; Rius and Darling 
  <a rid="b245" ref-type="bibr" href="#b245">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of genetic variation in successful invasions has proven contentious though, with authors often taking opposing views depending on the nature of the system that they study (Rius and Darling 
  <a rid="b245" ref-type="bibr" href="#b245">2014</a>). Indeed, many species have spread successfully with low genetic diversity (Myburgh et al. 
  <a rid="b204" ref-type="bibr" href="#b204">2007</a>; Darling et al. 
  <a rid="b77" ref-type="bibr" href="#b77">2008a</a>; Richards et al. 
  <a rid="b236" ref-type="bibr" href="#b236">2012</a>). The success of invaders with low genetic variability may depend on the nature of the environment into which they invade; weedy species moving into agricultural landscapes may require less genetic variability because they enter a relatively homogeneous landscape, whereas for species invading natural environments, a high level of variability may be required (Moran and Alexander 
  <a rid="b201" ref-type="bibr" href="#b201">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genomic approaches provide a means to help resolve the apparent paradox. For example, success with limited genetic diversity may be due to the expression of phenotypic plasticity, aided by epigenetic responses to the environment (Richards et al. 
  <a rid="b236" ref-type="bibr" href="#b236">2012</a>) that can be identified with genomic approaches. Epigenetic mechanisms may be particularly important in these situations because they generate heritable changes in response to environmental cues, although their ecological significance remains unclear (Bossdorf et al. 
  <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2008</a>). Alternatively, functional traits may remain variable even when genetic variation is low, as the loss of rare alleles will not greatly affect the quantitative trait distribution, and nonadditive genetic variance may either aid in fitness directly, or be converted to additive variance due to allele frequency shifts (Dlugosch and Parker 
  <a rid="b88" ref-type="bibr" href="#b88">2008</a>; Dawson et al. 
  <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">2012</a>; Le Roux et al. 
  <a rid="b169" ref-type="bibr" href="#b169">2013</a>). Genomic tools provide a way of identifying variation in functional traits (see next section). They also provide new means to understand the nature of introductions of invasive species. As mentioned in the previous section, genomic markers provide a much higher level of resolution when identifying source populations, and they can therefore clearly indicate the number of introductions from different environmental regions involved in invasions.
