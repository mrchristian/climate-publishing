 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global climate change is likely to exacerbate droughts in the years to come.[
  <a rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref30">30</a>] Changes in precipitation patterns are likely to lead to increased floods in some areas while prolonged droughts are expected in other areas. A relationship has been found between the occurrence of drought and farmer suicides.[
  <a rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref31">31</a>
  <a rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref32">32</a>] Such a trend has not only been found in developed country like Australia, but also in developing the country like India.[

  <a rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref34">34</a>] Association has been found between crop failures due to unexpected droughts and suicide attempts in the farmers. Failure of crop can lead to economic hardships. When dependent on low precipitation situations, the farmer might not be able to sustain the expenses of the family and may become a victim of the debt trap to meet the expenses. Second, it may also lead to rise in expenses of food and other goods in the region. Inability to make basic purchases can lead to malnutrition and risk of other infections, especially in developing countries where structural social services are not efficiently organized. Third, droughts are also often associated with prolonged exposure to warm, dry season. As above, it seems likely that exposure to heat can lead to increased rates of suicide attempts. Fourth, prolonged droughts can lead an individual to migrate to another region and/or pursue another vocation. This leads to acculturation stress which may further lead to suicide attempts in the farmer population. Since much of the world population depends on the farmers for their food supply, health care of the farmers is an important issue and efforts are required to provide help to them when needed. Moreover, since the majority of the farmers live in rural areas while healthcare facilities are concentrated in urban areas, efforts are required for easy access to services to this population.
