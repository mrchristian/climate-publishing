 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increased exposure to heat is likely to become more common with the rise in the global temperatures. It has been suggested that there is a relation between temperature rise and aggressive behavior.[
  <a rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref10">10</a>] Increase in rates of criminality and aggression have been observed during the hot summer months, suggesting a link between aggressive behaviors and temperatures.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heat waves have been associated with mental and behavioral disorders. A study from Australia suggests that heat waves are associated with increased rates of admissions for mental disorders also, in conjunction with other disorders such as cardiovascular and renal illness.[
  <a rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref16">16</a>] Such heat waves have been associated with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia and anxiety related disorders among others.[
  <a rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref17">17</a>] Extreme heat exposure can lead to physical as well as psychological exhaustion.[
  <a rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref18">18</a>] A study from Thailand suggests that occupational heat stress is associated with greater psychological distress among the workers.[
  <a rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref19">19</a>] Similar other studies have found an association between increased temperatures in the work place and greater psychological distress.[
