 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PV power output at a site depends on two factors: its PV power generation potential (PVpot) and the installed capacity. As defined and used in this study, PVpot is a dimensionless magnitude accounting for the performance of the PV cells with respect to their nominal power capacity according to the actual ambient conditions. Therefore, PVpot multiplied by the nominal installed watts of PV power capacity gives instantaneous PV power production.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PVpot mainly involves the amount of the resource (RSDS) but also the influence that other atmospheric variables may have on the efficiency of the PV cells, which diminishes as their temperature increases
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>. According to the literature
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>, it can be expressed as:

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence, if ambient conditions (RSDS, TAS and VWS) correspond to the STCs, PVpot equals 1 and PV power production reaches the rated value. If they are so that 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>cell</sub> is higher (lower) than 25 °C and/or RSDS lower (higher) than 1,000 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, PVpot will be lower (higher) than the unit and the PV power output will be lower (higher) than the nominal power of the module.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial distribution of PV power-installed capacity was obtained with the CLIMIX model as in ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a>. Here it is applied to the 2050 regional targets set by the European Climate Foundation Roadmap 2050 in its 80% RES pathway
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a> using the 0.11°-resolution working grid defined for EURO-CORDEX (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). CLIMIX performs an optimization exercise based on the resource availability for allocating PV plants (that is, by default, the preferred locations are those where RSDS is most abundant), but without overloading the best locations with huge deployments of PV installations, discarding sites previously identified as forestry or inaccessible areas and taking into account the population distribution.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the PVpot time series estimated as described above and the 2050 spatial scenario of PV power-installed capacity, 3-h time series of PV power generation were obtained for each grid cell of the domain holding PV power units. These series were finally aggregated per region, considering those regions for which the aforementioned 2050 targets were specified (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). As a result, nine 3-h time series of PV power generation spanning the period 1970–2099 were obtained, one per region, from each one of the available simulations. Ensemble mean values of their means and standard deviations (as computed here to assess changes in time variability) are presented in
