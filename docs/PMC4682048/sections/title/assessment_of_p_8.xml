 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change signals from each individual ensemble member are computed as the difference between the value of the assessed magnitude in a 30-year-long future period (namely, 2070–2099) and its value in the reference period 1970–1999. The statistical significance of changes is evaluated using the Student's 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-test imposing 
  <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;0.05. For mean PVpot, mean VWS and mean PV power production, changes are expressed in relative terms (% with respect to the reference climatology); otherwise changes represent just the difference between future and historical values. Note that since variability is expressed here in %, variability changes are also given in %, but they do not represent variations in relative terms.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ensemble mean (
  <span class="italic">E</span>
  <sub>mean</sub>) signals are computed as the arithmetic mean of the set of individual signals within each ensemble. The following criteria are used to consider them as either uncertain or negligible: at least two significant individual signals differ in the sign of the projected change (uncertain); the uncertainty condition is not fulfilled and less than a half of the individual signals are significant (negligible). Otherwise, the ensemble mean signals are referred to as robust.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, ensemble maximum and minimum (
  <span class="italic">E</span>
  <sub>max</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">E</span>
  <sub>min</sub>, respectively) signals are computed as the maximum and minimum values, respectively, of the whole set of individual signals. The ensemble spread denotes the range between these two limit values.
