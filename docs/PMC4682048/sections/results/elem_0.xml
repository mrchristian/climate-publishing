  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ensemble mean pattern of change for mean RSDS, 2070–2099 versus 1970–1999 climatologies (computed without excluding night-time hours), under the RCP8.5 shows positive signals (about 5 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>) in Southern Mediterranean regions, negative signals northwards (about −10 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>, down to −20 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> in the northernmost areas) and an intermediate strip where the sign of the change is not robust (

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</a>). This latitudinal response is typical of that of the North Atlantic Oscillation during its positive phase, which induces windier and cloudier conditions in northern Europe, less windy and cloudy southwards, compared with what prevails during its negative phases
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">13</a>. Thus, the above picture could suggest the imprint of the small but positive trend projected for this large-scale mode of climate variability
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">14</a>, since more intense, frequent or persistent positive North Atlantic Oscillation phases would lead to enhanced (depleted) solar radiation in southern (northern) areas within Europe. Weak but significant positive signals expand northwards reaching central regions such as the North of France and Austria, and could occasionally grow up to 20 W m

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, the ensemble mean projected changes for PVpot (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>; individual patterns of change in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</a>) unveil negative values in the entire domain of around −10% under RCP8.5, except for small areas where the mean signal is either negligible (Southwestern Iberia) or of uncertain sign (West of France and coastal areas from Italy to Turkey). The corresponding extreme patterns (
   <span class="italic">E</span>
   <sub>max</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">E</span>
   <sub>min</sub>) show signals up to ±20%. Under RCP4.5, signals are similarly distributed but reduced by about a factor of 2 relative to RCP8.5 (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>). These results frame well with previous findings
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">3</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">7</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">8</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">9</a>, but PVpot changes have a more negative sign in northern and central areas compared with previous works, which can be attributed to the downscaling process since GCMs used in EURO-CORDEX provide a consistently different picture from that of RCMs (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</a>). In-depth investigation of this feature is beyond the aim of this study, but needs to be addressed in future works to get a higher confidence in the results.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonally (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>), the largest ensemble mean RSDS change signals (expressed in absolute terms, that is, in W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>) occur in spring and summer, when most PV power is produced. The latitudinal pattern (positive southwards and negative northwards) is found in all seasons. These changes, combined with the lower-order effect of changes in TAS and VWS, lead to changes in PVpot that expressed in relative terms (that is, %), are largest in winter (up to −20%) and smallest in summer. However, in summer, the discrepancy in the sign of the change between individual significant signals provides non-robust ensemble mean signals in large areas of Central Europe, a feature not seen in the other seasons.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the role of TAS and VWS for PVpot projections, it is evident that the positive (negative) changes in radiation are downgraded (strengthened) by the poorer panel efficiency in a TAS-increased scenario (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a–d</a>). This is in agreement with previous studies based on different assumptions
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">3</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">8</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>. While projections for VWS are largely uncertain, having a negligible impact on PVpot (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1e,f</a>), projections for TAS are positive in the whole domain, varying from 3 to 5 °C in the RCP8.5 ensemble mean pattern, and have associated mean induced changes in PVpot of −3% in the South and East of Europe (see the procedure followed for these estimates in Methods; 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</a> shows the results for the RCP4.5 case). TAS changes exert the largest influence on PVpot over southern regions in summer, while it is largely negligible in the winter season (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>). Although the projected increase in RSDS largely compensates such TAS-induced effects, these results call for future efforts to reduce the dependence of the PV cells performance on the ambient temperature, as already stated in ref. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in PV power production per region</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Going a step further to evaluate changes in actual PV power generation, we now make assumptions on where the PV power capacity is/will be installed in Europe. For that, the CLIMIX model
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a> is applied to the regional objectives for the PV sector proposed by the European Climate Foundation Roadmap 2050 (ref. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>) in the 80% renewable energy supply (RES) pathway (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>; see Methods for more details). Under such a fixed scenario of high-PV penetration, a general and progressive decline of the generated PV power is found in all regions along the entire period (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). This is most pronounced in the northernmost region 1, with ensemble mean projected changes up to −6% and −10% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. In Northern, Western and Central Europe (regions 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6) changes of −3 to −6% are obtained by the end of the century. In Southern Europe, changes are smaller (see also 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4a</a>). Note that the fact that changes are expressed here in relative terms partly contributes to obtain the smallest changes over regions and seasons (see also 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</a>) with the highest potential (that is, southwards, summertime).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Except for the regions 4 and 9, the mean projected changes under RCP8.5 exceed the current interannual variability of the PV production series from 2050 onwards (we will call this detectability of the mean change hereafter; see Methods). Under RCP4.5, only the regions 1, 5 and 6 display detectable mean changes from 2050 onwards, and regions 2 and 3 at the very end of the century (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>; 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</a>). However, in all cases the magnitude of the ensemble mean projected changes, even for those noted as robust in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4a</a>, is smaller than the ensemble spread, indicating a relatively high degree of uncertainty compared with the magnitude of the ensemble mean signals. Only for region 1, and especially under RCP8.5 towards the end of the century, the signal-to-noise ratio (S2N; see Methods) exceeds 1 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). In regions 2, 3, 5 and 6, with mean changes of about 5% and spreads of 10% by the end of the period, S2N falls down to as far as 0.5 (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</a>). It drops to even below 0.5 in regions 4, 7, 8 and 9 (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</a>), although this is neither surprising nor very relevant because mean changes in these regions are (1) close to zero, thus providing a close-to-zero value for the numerator of the S2N ratio, and (2) generally non-robust, that is, the spread mostly involves non-significant signals.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To better understand the aforementioned uncertainty, a two-step one-way analysis of variance
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a> is applied to the set of time series of PV power production anomalies to discern the roles played by the RCP, the GCM and the RCM choice. Results (shown in the small subplots of 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>) unveil that the choice of the RCP exerts a small role in explaining the variance among the whole set of time series compared with the GCM+RCM-induced spread, while its influence grows along the century. Overall, the influence of the GCM prevails in the northernmost regions, while in the southern and central regions the RCM plays a dominant role. These latter regions, namely 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9, are located in South-central Europe, where regional feedbacks involving temperature, soil moisture and clouds are particularly important
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>, inducing a higher variety of model responses than in northern areas with weakly constrained land–atmosphere interactions
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>. Besides, these southernmost areas have a highly complex orography, which has a strong impact on the simulated regional climates. Worth to note that, while RCMs thus appear more tightly constrained by their driving GCM northwards than southwards, RCMs are able to turn the sign of the projected change in the resource from positive to negative in some northern areas (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</a>). However, as it occurs similarly for all RCMs driven by the same GCM, it is not reflected in the results of the analysis of variance.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we focus on a key aspect of all weather-dependent renewable energies concerning their grid integration and management: the temporal stability of their supply. Our results indicate that changes in the monthly and annual variability of the PV production series (see Methods) are overall non-significant (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4b,c</a>), while significant reductions of the interannual variability in the winter series of eastern regions appear in the seasonal analysis (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</a>). Although in some cases the ensemble spread leads to uncertainty concerning the mean signals, projected changes in variability at these timescales (annual and monthly) of each of the models separately remain in the range (−1.5%;+3%) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4b,c</a>). By contrast, robust decreases are found for daily variability in a few regions, namely 4 and 8 (ranging from −3 to −9% to the end of the century depending on the region and the RCP), indicating a slightly higher temporal stability of the daily PV production (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4d</a>). This is most evident in region 4, where it occurs in all seasons but winter (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5m–p</a>) and despite the fact that the daily variability of TAS is projected to increase there, being therefore lead by the projected reduction of the daily variability of RSDS (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</a>). In the central region 6, however, a robust positive signal for changes in daily variability is found assuming RCP8.5 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4d</a>). These changes would occur progressively along the entire period, being consistently smaller by mid-century (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</a>).
