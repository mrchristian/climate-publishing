 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The issues of global changes, climate change and tick-borne diseases are becoming the order of the day (

  <a rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib35">Estrada-Peña et al., 2014b</a>, 
  <a rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib71">Ogden et al., 2013</a>, 
  <a rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib30">Estrada-Peña and de la Fuente, 2014</a>, 
  <a rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib43">Granter et al., 2014</a>, 
  <a rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib79">Parham et al., 2015</a>, 
  <a rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib65">Medlock and Leach, 2015</a>). There is convincing evidence indicating the direct or indirect effects of global changes on tick-borne diseases. Importantly, it is impossible to disconnect the mutual influences of global changes such as deforestation, land use change, and climate change on tick-borne pathogen transmission systems, as several of these factors may act synergistically on hosts, vectors, pathogens and humans themselves.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many recent studies have investigated the influence of climate change on tick-borne disease upturn in different parts of the world. For instance, 
  <a rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib109">Parola et al. (2008)</a> correlated a cluster of Mediterranean spotted fever cases to a warming-mediated increase in the aggressiveness of brown dog ticks. Climate change has been implicated as an important driving force for the expansion of the taiga tick 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes persulcatus</span> habitat and the incidence of tick-borne encephalitis in the north of European Russia (
  <a rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib100">Tokarevich et al., 2011</a>). It is also recognized that 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi</span> sensu lato are spreading to northern latitudes and to higher altitudes as a result of the effects of climate change on host populations and on tick development, survival and seasonal activity (
  <a rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib63">Mannelli et al., 2012</a>, 
  <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Léger et al., 2013</a>, 
  <a rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib64">Medlock et al., 2013</a>). Nonetheless, the relationship between climate change and tick-borne diseases is not uniform across all regions and tick species. For instance, 
  <a rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib36">Feria-Arroyo et al. (2014)</a> used a maximum entropy approach to forecast the present and future distribution of 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span>-infected 
  <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span> in the Texas–Mexico transboundary region by correlating geographic data with climatic variables. According to this modelling approach, habitat suitable for the distribution of 
  <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span> in the Texas–Mexico transboundary region will remain relatively stable until 2050. In the same way, the increased incidence of tick-borne encephalitis in Sweden during 2011–2012 is apparently more correlated to host population dynamics than to climate factors (
  <a rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib78">Palo, 2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impact of climate change on tick-borne diseases has long been a subject of debate (
  <a rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib40">Gilbert, 2010</a>, 
  <a rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib84">Randolph, 2010</a>) and is still a controversial issue. While some models suggest dramatic range expansions of 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> ticks and tick-borne diseases as a result of climate warming, predicted distributions may also vary widely with the models’ assumptions (
  <a rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib75">Ostfeld and Brunner, 2015</a>). It has been stated that the impact of global warming on tick-borne diseases will be more evident at the geographical limits of current distributions, where suboptimal temperatures are currently limiting the spread of infected vectors (
  <a rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib85">Randolph, 2013</a>). 
  <a rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib75">Ostfeld and Brunner (2015)</a> argued that more data on key tick-demographic and climatic processes, as well as the incorporation of non-climatic processes are required to develop better models.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat disturbances may alter terrestrial mammal communities and tick-borne pathogen transmission systems. For instance, 
  <a rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib61">Lou et al. (2014)</a> developed a model to investigate the joint effects of seasonal temperature variation and host community composition on 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> transmission by 
  <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span>. They proposed a stage-structured periodic model by integrating seasonal tick development and activity, multiple host species and complex pathogen transmission routes between ticks and reservoirs. In such model, climate warming can amplify and slightly change the seasonality of disease risk. Both the dilution and amplification effects could be detected by feeding the model with different animal hosts.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although there has been considerable debate on the biodiversity-buffers-disease paradigm (
  <a rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib86">Randolph and Dobson, 2012</a>, 
  <a rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib87">Randolph and Dobson, 2013</a>, 
  <a rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib74">Ostfeld, 2013</a>, 
  <a rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib93">Salkeld et al., 2013</a>, 
  <a rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib106">Wood et al., 2014</a>), recent studies assessing the effects of host diversity on Lyme disease risk or incidence at both small and large scales have found very strong support for dilution effect (
  <a rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib102">Turney et al., 2014</a>, 
  <a rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib104">Werden et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, a new meta-analysis of 202 effect sizes on 61 parasite species provided widespread support for dilution effects across different ecological contexts, indication that biodiversity declines could increase human and wildlife diseases and decrease crop and forest production (
