 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Life is an unpredictable, but finite process. Our dead-end journey on this planet begins from the moment we are born. In the famous 1955 play 
  <span class="italic">Auto da Compadecida</span>, by the late Ariano Suassuna, the character Chicó says about his friend's death: “Cumpriu sua sentença e encontrou-se com o único mal irremediável, aquilo que é a marca de nosso estranho destino sobre a terra, aquele fato sem explicação que iguala tudo o que é vivo num só rebanho de condenados, porque tudo o que é vivo morre”; translated from the Portuguese this means: “He fulfilled his sentence and met with the only irredeemable evil, which is the mark of our strange destiny on Earth, that unexplainable fact that equates all living beings into a flock of convicts, because all that is alive dies”. When Chicó (the most cowardly of men and an insatiable liar) said “all that is alive dies” he was fatally telling the truth. Although we may be living shorter lifespans than we could (
  <a rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib105">Werfel et al., 2015</a>), nobody lives forever. But even if life is finite, our existence is still an intriguing, unpredictable process. Indeed, improvements in healthcare practices, nutrition, housing, sanitation, working conditions, and efforts towards a more universal access to healthcare have greatly increased our lifespan in the past centuries, even in developing countries (
  <a rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib3">Atun et al., 2015</a>). We are living more, but we want to live better.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The life of any living creature on Earth is influenced by the climate. Plants, terrestrial mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects and other invertebrates are all influenced and, to some extent, dependent on climate. Earth's climate used to be cooler than today. Since the end of the last ice age (10,000 years ago), we have lived in a relatively warm period with stable carbon dioxide concentration. Over the last 200 years, the rate of carbon dioxide accumulation due to our emissions has increased to unprecedented levels (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.theccc.org.uk/" id="intref0030" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.theccc.org.uk/</span>). This is amplifying the natural greenhouse effect and contributing to changes in the Earth's climate, including atmospheric and oceanic warming (
  <a rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib95">Shevenell et al., 2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The future of the Earth's climate is uncertain in the long term. Hence, the impact of climate change on biodiversity and on tick-borne diseases at local to global scales is unpredictable. Some causes and consequences of climate may vary in space and time, sometimes being reversible. Can we slow down our unsustainable population growth through family planning? Can we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by exploring alternative, renewable energy sources? Can we reforest and re-wild the world? Will this positively influence our existence on this planet?</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between tick development rates and temperature is nonlinear, as the relationship between entomological measures of infection and human risk of vector-borne diseases (
  <a rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib47">Hollingsworth et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, there are also several methodological caveats (e.g., use of inadequate environmental variables, differences between real and visible tick populations) that should be taken into account while developing models to investigate tick responses to changes in climate and host densities (
  <a rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib25">Dobson, 2014a</a>, 
  <a rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib31">Estrada-Peña et al., 2014a</a>, 
  <a rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib32">Estrada-Peña et al., 2015</a>). Further studies are needed to investigate the complex relationships between landscape, climate, host communities (biodiversity), tick demography (see 
  <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">Balashov, 2012</a>), pathogen diversity, human demography, human behaviour, economics, politics, and human exposure to pathogens, also considering all ecological processes (e.g., trophic cascades) and other possible interactions (mutual effects of increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased deforestation rates). The elevated number of variables and of interacting factors involved and their complexity make tick-borne pathogen transmission systems beyond (current) human comprehension (
  <a rid="tbox1" ref-type="boxed-text" href="#tbox1">Box 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strong commitment of scientists and professionals from different disciplines (e.g., medicine, veterinary, parasitology, biology, ecology, epidemiology, statistics, geography, physics, mathematics, and anthropology) will be needed to address tick-borne diseases from a broad perspective. It may be anticipated that warmer winters and extended autumn and spring seasons will continue to drive the expansion of the distribution of some tick species (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span>) to northern latitudes and to higher altitudes. Livestock movements will also play a role in the latitudinal dispersion of ticks in some areas (
  <a rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>). Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether and to what extent climate change will influence the upsurge of tick-borne diseases in new areas and/or their re-emergence in core endemic areas. Certainly, other factors such as urbanization, population growth, economic downturn, and political crisis (
  <a rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib98">Sumilo et al., 2008</a>, 
  <a rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib42">Godfrey and Randolph, 2011</a>) should also be considered while assessing this multifaceted problem. Furthermore, it is now more evident than ever that biodiversity loss may increase disease risk (see 
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Civitello et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, humans have now another relevant reason for conserving wildlife.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human development is transforming most of Earth's natural systems, but the health impacts of ecosystem alteration are still poorly understood (reviewed in 
  <a rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib70">Myers et al., 2013</a>). Human behaviour is also a strong determinant of environmental health, animal health and human health. With regard to tick-borne diseases, changes in human behaviour may result in diverging outcomes in terms of transmission risk. Even if general conditions are favourable to transmission in a given region, the avoidance of tick-infested habitats by people could change the outcome of the transmission risk model. Likewise, even if a person bitten by a tick, the rapid removal of this tick may reduce the transmission risk to near zero.
