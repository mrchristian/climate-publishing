 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, proximity to the coast was associated with increased belief that climate change is real and increased support for government regulation of carbon emissions, irrespective of regional differences in affluence, residencies' average height above sea level, and individual differences in sex, age, education, political orientation, and wealth. These findings are in line with the other two studies showing that proximity to the coast is related to greater risk perception associated with global climate change 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Brody2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Brody2">[37]</a> and with greater willingness to lower personal emissions 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Brody1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Brody1">[29]</a>. Altogether, the findings demonstrate the importance of geographic location in engaging with the problem of climate change, expanding the profile of our understanding of climate-change-related perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all three studies, the findings indicate an association only; the studies were not able to discover the direction of the causal arrow. It may be that people with stronger belief in climate change tend to seek out coastal areas, or there might be some third variable (e.g., connectedness to nature) that causes both an increase in climate change belief and the tendency to reside in coastal areas. However, the theory of psychological distance 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Milfont1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Milfont1">[19]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Leiserowitz3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Leiserowitz3">[21]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Spence1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Spence1">[22]</a> predicts that the experience or perception of greater climate change impacts, such as can be expected at the coasts 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-IPCC1">[35]</a>, will bring the issue psychologically closer. This, in turn, is predicted to at least partially cause an increase in related variables such as belief in climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Proximity to the coast certainly allows several possible ways in which belief in climate change could increase. For example, people residing at the coasts may be more likely to 1) experience large, climate-change-related impacts such as flooding and storms 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Spence2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Spence2">[31]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Reser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Reser1">[32]</a>, many of which are likely to have greater impact on coastal communities 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-IPCC1">[35]</a>, 2) consider potential sea-level rise, which may require local adaptation 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Evans1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Evans1">[30]</a>, or 3) pay more attention to the local weather, as they plan to spend time outdoors at the beach. People residing at the coasts may also have an increased attunement to natural risk, since the ocean, as a large and constantly agitated body of water, may inspire a sense of respect for the power of nature and its changeability, and/or they may have an increased attunement to environmental problems of all types because such residents may care about the state of their beaches, pay attention to them, and have seen problems occur before. In sum, although the presented results are only an association, we note that such a causal relationship is consistent with psychological distance theory 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Milfont1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Milfont1">[19]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Spence1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Spence1">[22]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future research should seek to discover causality wherever possible. Longitudinal studies may be of interest; for example, researchers could examine climate-change-related variables across time among people who have moved closer to or more distant from the coast. Researchers could also consider including an item that specifically measures feelings of closeness or distance from climate change so that they can observe whether individual variables affect psychological distance in different ways. For example, weather-aware individuals may feel closer to climate change than others, but perhaps there is no difference between people who do or do not pay attention to the state of their beaches. Where possible, researchers should also specifically test for mediation by psychological distance. Statistical mediation tests the hypothesis that a mediator variable, such as psychological distance, is the intermediate cause between two other variables. For example, one could test the hypothesis that proximity to the coast causes an increase in psychological closeness to climate change, which in turn causes an increase in climate change belief.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are, of course, other factors affecting climate change concern besides psychological distance. We have already mentioned that there are effects of socio-demographic variables such as age, sex, education, wealth, and political orientation 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Fairbrother1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Fairbrother1">[40]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Zelezny1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Zelezny1">[48]</a>, along with a variety of psychological barriers 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Gifford1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Gifford1">[16]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Swim1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Swim1">[20]</a>. In addition, there is evidence that climate change concern is also affected by personality factors, such as individuals' traits and tendency to consider the potential future consequences of their actions 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Milfont3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Milfont3">[52]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Milfont5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Milfont5">[54]</a>, as well as one's trust in scientists 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Malka1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Malka1">[55]</a> and (dis)belief in conspiracy theories 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Lewandowsky1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Lewandowsky1">[56]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, however, communicators are not in a position to change many of these other factors, such as personality factors and individual wealth. What the psychological distance evidence suggests, though, is that they may be able to create targeted campaigns—for example, discussing with individual metropolitan areas the effects they might expect to experience, and how to prepare for them. (This specific tactic has already been tested, resulting in an increase in willingness to reduce personal emissions 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Evans1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Evans1">[30]</a>.) Another tactic might include encouraging people to consider more deeply their experiences of local weather and environmental habitats, which may have already changed during their lifetimes—for example, unprecedented pine beetle outbreaks in North America have caused visible damage to forest areas 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Kurz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Kurz1">[57]</a>. Additionally, if the goal is to increase awareness of the risks in general, expending more energy on inland communities may be helpful, as it is clear that coastal communities are already slightly more risk-aware 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Brody2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Brody2">[37]</a>. Ultimately, our findings support the view that psychological distance theory has important practical implications for climate change communication.
