 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The vast majority of climate scientists (97–98%) agree with the reality and human causes of climate change 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Anderegg1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Anderegg1">[1]</a>. However, it is clear that climate change poses a unique and profoundly complex problem, one that is not easily communicated. A study found that only 53% of the New Zealand public believe climate change is real and caused by humans, while 10% do not believe in climate change, 7% believe it is real but not caused by humans, and a large proportion (31%) remain undecided 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Sibley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Sibley1">[2]</a>. Surveys conducted in the U.S. report similar results, with three showing that around 63–69% of Americans believe global warming is happening 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Borick1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Borick1">[3]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Pew1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Pew1">[5]</a> and another reporting that 82% of Americans believe climate change is happening 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Stanford1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Stanford1">[6]</a>. Other Western countries also show relatively moderate levels of concern compared to climate scientists 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Ratter1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Ratter1">[7]</a>. At the same time, support for action to reduce global warming is moderate to high: 64% of New Zealanders say that citizens should be exerting more effort toward combating climate change 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Horizon1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Horizon1">[8]</a>, and, when they were shown 19 possible government policy options to reduce emissions, New Zealanders showed more support than opposition for all, with majority support for 17 of the policy options 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Scoop1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Scoop1">[9]</a>. Again similarly, 68% of the U.S. public supports medium to large-scale efforts to tackle climate change 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Leiserowitz2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Leiserowitz2">[10]</a>. Altogether, New Zealanders, similarly to Americans, want action taken on climate change, but it is clear that the public is significantly less certain about the threat than the scientists.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scientists have tried communicating facts as one avenue to bridge the gap between scientific evidence and public perceptions of global climate change. But this deficit model of communication, which assumes that the public merely needs to be informed or enlightened via the presentation of facts in order to perceive the existing risks, is now largely considered to be too simple 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Nerlich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Nerlich1">[11]</a>. Lack of information is indeed one barrier for public awareness of climate change risks, in concert with the distortion of information due to the disproportionate representation of contrarians in popular media 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Boykoff1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Boykoff1">[12]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Oreskes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Oreskes1">[13]</a>. However, the idea of psychological barriers has been gaining traction: There are a whole host of potential attitudes, beliefs, and feelings that can hinder perceiving, understanding, and acting upon climate change. For example, the way people tend to conceive issues differs when the problem is only described to them, as opposed to experienced over time 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Hertwig1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Hertwig1">[14]</a>. In one study, people's misconceptions about CO
  <sub>2</sub> were significantly reduced when they participated in a climate change simulator, as opposed to merely receiving summary information about it 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Dutt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Dutt1">[15]</a>. Additionally, in the last decades psychologists have identified numerous other barriers 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Gifford1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Gifford1">[16]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Swim1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Swim1">[20]</a>, which include (but may not be limited to): uncertainty, skepticism, distrust in information sources, externalizing responsibility and blame, optimism bias, attention to other priorities, reluctance to change lifestyles, habit, fatalism, a “drop in the ocean” feeling, lack of perceived political, business, and/or industry action, ideological, political and religious beliefs, worry about free riders, social norms/expectations, lack of enabling initiatives, belief in technological salvation, and the perception that climate change is a distant threat.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In particular, this last barrier––psychological distance––manifests in feelings that the problem is too uncertain (likelihood distance), will occur far away (geographical distance), far in the future (temporal distance), and to people different from oneself (social distance) 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Leiserowitz2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Leiserowitz2">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Leiserowitz3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Leiserowitz3">[21]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Spence1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Spence1">[22]</a>. For example, the geographical distance of environmental problems, including global warming, is apparent in respondents from 26 countries, who overall indicated that problems are likely to affect distant areas more severely than local ones 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Schultz1">[23]</a>. Notably, the countries surveyed were both economically and environmentally diverse: Their Gross National Products varied widely, and the countries also varied on environmental performance in five domains, such as the level of local environmental impact on humans. The perceived geographical distance was unrelated to these objective indicators of country wealth and environmental quality––that is, respondents from these countries tended to perceive global warming as affecting others more than themselves, even when they are poorer and/or more environmentally vulnerable than others. Self-reported psychological distance has also been shown to be associated with both lower climate change concern and diminished willingness to reduce energy use 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Spence1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Spence1">[22]</a>, suggesting that when people experience psychological distance, it negatively affects both their climate change concern and their willingness to take action.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strength of those feelings of psychological distance from climate change may be influenced by people's perceptions and beliefs about the levels of risk, as well as by actual exposure to hazards 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Slovic1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Slovic1">[24]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0103180-McClure1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-McClure1">[28]</a>. For example, the perception of increased climate change risk to the self and family is linked to willingness to change behaviors 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Brody1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Brody1">[29]</a>. Similarly, when people consider possible local adaptations to climate change—an action that likely increases thoughts about local risk—this also increases their willingness to take personal action to reduce emissions 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Evans1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Evans1">[30]</a>. More directly, personal experience with climate change effects, such as flooding or extreme weather events, is related to greater climate change concern 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Spence2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Spence2">[31]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Reser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Reser1">[32]</a>, especially when the events are recognized as related to climate change 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Reser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Reser1">[32]</a>. Even experiencing a warmer-than-usual day increases climate change concern 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Li1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Li1">[33]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Zaval1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Zaval1">[34]</a>. In general, exposure to personal risk or awareness of greater personal risk increases concern and/or willingness to act.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since prior experience of weather events is intrinsically related to the region in which one lives, geographic location is another factor with the strong possibility of affecting psychological distance to climate change. In particular, in the present paper we focus on proximity to the coastline. Although all types of regions will experience climate changes of varying levels of severity, an IPCC report suggests that, in addition to mountain settlements and megacities, coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-IPCC1">[35]</a>, possibly because they must bear the brunt of sea-level rise, changing wind patterns, and/or increasingly severe tropical storms 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Nicholls1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Nicholls1">[36]</a>. Thus, coastal dwellers' experience of current climate change impacts may be increased, and this may in turn lower their psychological distance to climate change––that is, they may take warnings of climate change more seriously because they feel they are beginning to experience it themselves. Accordingly, some studies have already focused on perceptions of risk near the coastline. For example, Brody et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Brody2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Brody2">[37]</a> showed in a U.S. study that risk from climate change is perceived to be significantly lower for respondents located farther away from the coastline. Indeed, among the other geo-physical variables considered in this study (e.g., relative elevation, sea-level rise/inundation risk, temperature trend), distance to the coast had the strongest association with climate change risk perception. Further, in another national sample of U.S. residents, Brody et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Brody1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Brody1">[29]</a> found proximity to the coast to be significantly and positively related to willingness to reduce personal emissions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These U.S. findings support the view that proximity to the coast is an important variable to consider when examining public risk perception and willingness to act in response to climate change. Given that no similar studies have been conducted outside of the U.S., we chose to examine the distance to coast effect in a national probability sample of a coastal nation: New Zealand. We measured climate change belief and support for government action to regulate emissions, two similar but distinct outcome variables compared to previous ones (i.e., risk perception and willingness to reduce personal emissions). In addition to the value of such a study for Australasian researchers and policymakers, we hope that an independent study, conducted on a different national sample, will have international relevance by adding confidence that proximity affects climate change attitudes in general. The findings could also have theoretical implication for the psychological distance of climate change.</p>
