 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NZAVS-09 questionnaire was posted to 40,500 New Zealanders randomly selected from the 2009 New Zealand electoral roll. Roughly 1.36% of all people registered to vote were contacted and invited to participate. The NZAVS-09 contained responses from 6,518 participants, with a response rate of 16.6% 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Sibley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Sibley2">[38]</a>. Complete data for all exogenous measures analyzed here were available for 5,815 participants (missing data among the two endogenous measures was estimated using Full Information Maximum Likelihood).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sample consisted of 60% (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3,487) women and 40% (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 2,328) men, with a mean age of 47.72 (
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 15.60). With regard to education, 22.3% (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,295) had no formal qualifications or did not report the qualification, 29.4% (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,709) had some high school, 16.2% (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 941) had a post-high school diploma or certificate, 23.0% (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,335) had completed or were studying toward an undergraduate degree, and 9.2% (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 535) had or were studying toward a post-graduate qualification. Participants' mean annual household income was $NZ 84,604 (
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 70,629). Missing values for household income were replaced with the mean. To make the unstandardized slopes more interpretable, income was scaled in $10,000 units in the multilevel analyses.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In comparison to national census figures, the NZAVS data have overall more women and older, educated and wealthier respondents than the general New Zealand public

  <a rid="pone.0103180-Zelezny1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Zelezny1">[48]</a>, it is possible that our sample's responses on the outcome measures were higher than the general public's would be.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Political orientation was indexed by asking participants to rate their political orientation on a single-item scale from 1 (
  <span class="italic">extremely conservative</span>) to 7 (
  <span class="italic">extremely liberal</span>). Scores were reverse coded so that a higher score indicated greater political conservatism (
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 3.75, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 1.30).
