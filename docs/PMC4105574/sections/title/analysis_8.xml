 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multilevel modelling is recommended when there are two or more distinct, hierarchical levels of data 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Christ1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Christ1">[51]</a>. With the present data, geographic location is one level and individuals another: One would expect that individuals from a given area (within-group variance) would have more similar characteristics than individuals from different areas (between-group variance). Multilevel analysis allows researchers to model the area-level and individual-level variance independently and simultaneously. We therefore constructed a multilevel model assessing the association between distance to the coast and both belief about the reality of climate change and support for government regulation of carbon emissions. These two outcomes were modelled simultaneously, and their Level 1 and Level 2 residual covariances were also included to adjust for residual associations. The intercepts for both outcomes were modelled as random effects, thus allowing the mean level of each outcome to vary across meshblocks.

  <a rid="pone.0103180-Christ1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Christ1">[51]</a>. We first tested a model including only distance to the coast. We then tested a model that included sex, age, education, household income and political orientation at Level 1, and distance to the coast, height above sea level, the interaction between distance and height, and the level of economic deprivation of each meshblock at Level 2. This approach statistically adjusted for height above sea level, the interaction of height with distance, and the level of regional deprivation when assessing the association between distance to the coast and climate change attitudes, while also modelling the association between respondents' sex, age, education, political orientation and wealth on within-cluster variance. As noted above, studies have found that sex, age, education, political orientation, and wealth are all related to environmental concern
