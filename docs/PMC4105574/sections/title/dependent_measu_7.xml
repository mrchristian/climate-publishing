 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two outcome measures were measured with single-item questions and were embedded in a larger battery of Likert-type questions rated on scale from 1 (
  <span class="italic">strongly disagree</span>) to 7 (
  <span class="italic">strongly agree</span>). Belief about the reality of climate change was assessed using the single item “Climate change is real” (
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 5.37, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 1.68). Support for government regulation of carbon emissions policy was assessed using the single item “The New Zealand government should be involved in regulating carbon emissions” (
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 4.84, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 1.68). Previous analyses of these two items focusing on their links with behavior intentions and overall distribution in the population have been reported elsewhere

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that these measures, like many psychological measures, are self-reported and therefore potentially subject to socially desirable responding, in which participants may exaggerate responses according to what they believe to be approved by others or what the researchers want to hear. However, this bias, especially for a household survey in which the researcher is not physically present, is unlikely to significantly affect results. Additionally, it is extremely unlikely that any participants guessed the purpose of the present study.</p>
