 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous respondents in both public health groups spoke about the importance of legal mandates to support public health engagement in climate change. Jurisdiction for implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies varies amongst states that have policies in place, but are generally under the purview of environmental organizations such as the EPA, air boards, fire, water, and conservation agencies. Public health agencies are usually mandated to respond to emergent public health threats such as those caused by climate-related natural disasters and disease outbreaks, as well as limited occupational regulation (e.g., for heat risk). Few public health agencies have any explicit climate change-related mandates. A “PH engaged” gave this example: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“The overall direction and mandate in public health is missing the climate change component. How do you make heat-related illness a reportable disease to elevate it to other public health priorities like sexually transmitted infections?”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another “PH engaged” said: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“Public health is struggling to see how it fits in. From an agency perspective, people think it’s relevant, but are constrained by the fact that they don’t have jurisdictional authority to do something about it. Addressing climate change would be mitigating greenhouse gases, but there is no jurisdictional authority related to that at all. They may feel that their hands are tied.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While public health respondents said that they lack formal authority over climate change’s health impacts or drivers, respondents from all groups believed that the public health sector has a lot of informal authority amongst communities and decision-makers. They believe that public health professionals could use this informal authority to provide greater leadership and possibly even move towards formal mandates for public health to address climate change.</p>
