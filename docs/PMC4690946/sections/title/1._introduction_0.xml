 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This research examines why the public health sector in California is not more engaged with climate change work given current and impending threats to health, and the potential for climate change solutions to improve health outcomes and decrease health inequities (the unfair and avoidable differences in health status between populations). The purpose of this research is to inform efforts to increase public health work on climate change, strengthen partnerships between public health and climate change efforts, and formulate strategies that address the health impacts of climate change and health opportunities in climate change policies and planning.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change already endangers human health and well-being in numerous ways [

  <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-15010">2</a>]. Climate change threatens to disrupt the life support systems on which humans depend (food, air, water, shelter, security), and therefore, in concert with other global environmental changes, threatens our survival. Climate change also disproportionately impacts poor and marginalized populations [

  <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-15010">4</a>], thereby increasing health inequities. Climate change policies and strategies could have significant and immediate beneficial effects on public health and health equity, or “co-benefits”, through improving social determinants of health across many sectors [

  <a rid="B6-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-12-15010">6</a>,
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-12-15010">7</a>]. The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow up, live, work, and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, regional, and local levels, and are mostly responsible for health inequities [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-15010">8</a>]. Through their effect on social determinants of health, some climate change strategies can 
  <span class="italic">increase</span> the environmental, economic, and health burdens on communities already bearing the burden of cumulative environmental exposures, discrimination, poor health, and poverty [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Public health involvement in addressing climate change is crucial. Public health actions can do much to protect people from some of the health effects of climate change, with early action providing the largest health benefits [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-15010">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-12-15010">10</a>]. The health sector can play a vital role in helping the public and policy makers understand the magnitude of climate change effects on human health, and opportunities for health and health equity promotion in climate actions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many major public health organizations and leaders recognize climate change as an urgent public health issue [

  <a rid="B21-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-12-15010">21</a>]. Some state and local public health departments are conducting projects on climate adaptation, through funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yet public health engagement on climate change has been limited in light of the severity of the risks of climate change, and the magnitude of the opportunities climate change solutions present for health. One assessment of local agencies found that the gap between the demand for health and climate interventions and the resources available to health departments was greater than in any other sector [

To understand why these barriers persist and identify ways to promote engagement, we sought to understand the differences between public health practitioners currently working on climate change and those who are not. We also sought to understand the perspective of those working on climate change in other sectors on the potential for strengthening inter-sectoral collaboration (for this paper, inter-sectoral collaboration refers to the coordinated efforts of two or more sectors within government to improve outcomes, including working horizontally and vertically across different levels of government (local, regional, state, federal) [
