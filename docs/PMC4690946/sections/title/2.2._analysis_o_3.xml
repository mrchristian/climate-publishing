  <a rid="B36-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-12-15010">36</a>] qualitative data analysis software. First, the research team sorted data into broad “big bucket” code topics derived directly from the survey instrument. To ensure coding validity, three coders independently coded the same transcripts, compared them, discussed discrepancies in coding, and refined the coding scheme until reaching a high level of agreement on code application. The authors then conducted additional sub-coding, in-depth inductive and deductive thematic analysis, and analysis of patterns within and across participants groups and organization types.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Broad code topics for the analysis presented here included: (1) public health role in climate change, (2) barriers to public health participation, (3) opportunities supporting public health engagement, and (4) recommendations. Examples of sub-codes included urgency, leadership, politics, authority, siloed thinking and approach, public health as messenger, and support other sectors.</p>
