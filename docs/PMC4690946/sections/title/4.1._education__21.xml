 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In prior surveys of public health professionals, the majority of participants recognized that climate change impacts health. Many of the public health professionals we interviewed do not know or understand much about climate change and health nor believe they have adequate information to engage on the issue. Participants also did not appear to appreciate the interconnections between health, inequities, and climate change impacts and opportunities [

Although our research preceded the last National Climate Assessment and the release of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, there has been a growing body of evidence that climate change will affect health since the late 1980s, and more recent literature on the health co-benefits of climate action. A concerted effort is clearly needed to reach public health practitioners with this information in a way that fosters greater engagement and self-efficacy. More specific forecasting of the local health impacts of climate change may reduce the perception that climate change is so distant in time and place as not to pose any urgent challenge to public health.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Respondents from outside of the public health sector strongly articulated the potential value of the public health voice in communications to help catalyze public opinion to support more robust climate action. Because health education and communications are a routine component of virtually all public health programs, support for integration of climate change into public health messages could serve as a relatively easy first step to increased engagement.</p>
