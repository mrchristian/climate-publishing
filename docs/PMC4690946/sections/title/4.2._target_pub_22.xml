 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our research indicates the persistence of deficits in funding, leadership, knowledge, and workforce capacity found in previous surveys [
  <a rid="B27-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-12-15010">27</a>]. Some of these persistent deficits in public health institutional capacity may be attributable to barriers from within the field of public health (e.g., insular practice, conflict aversion, or siloed training), while others are likely shaped by institutional constraints from outside of public health.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, the political controversy about the science of climate change appears to significantly influence the willingness of public health professionals to speak publicly about climate change as a significant public health issue. Even among respondents who clearly understood the issue, felt the urgency, and saw relationships between their work and climate change, few felt comfortable making the links explicit and were reluctant to take public leadership on the issue. Given the extent of local and state focus on climate change in California, however, the fact that so many of our respondents still expressed hesitancy about talking about climate change is notable.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Public health staff’s mission is to protect and promote the public’s health. Yet they are aware of and fearful about the potential consequences of being vocal about climate change when those with power over budgets and jobs disavow it. It is unknown whether increased awareness of the general public’s level of concern and desire for government action on climate change [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-12-15010">39</a>] and the view of those in other sectors that health professionals can play a critical role on this issue could counter the impacts of politicization. Public health has a history of action on other politicized health issues, such as HIV/AIDS, needle exchange, and reproductive health, largely in the context of social movements around those issues. This data indicates that when governmental public health staff are constrained due to politicization, strong partnerships with non-governmental organizations and “inside-outside” strategies are needed to advance climate change and public health nexus work.
