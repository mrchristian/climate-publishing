 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is a threat to human health and survival, and climate solutions represent one of the biggest opportunities for advancing health and equity. Our research identifies both significant barriers to and opportunities for public health and partners to simultaneously address climate change, health, and health inequities. We hope this information will motivate and facilitate the public health sectorâ€™s participation in the fight against climate change, and strengthen relationships with other sectors engaged in climate change planning and policy-making.</p>
