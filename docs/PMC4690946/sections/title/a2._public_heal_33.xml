 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, can you tell me a little about the work you do, especially work which you think relates directly or indirectly to climate change or co-benefits?</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">* You’ve talked about climate change and its links to (public health topic areas they mentioned). Are there other areas where you see key connections between climate change and public health, for example like emergency preparedness, vector-borne diseases, chronic diseases, and how do you see those links? 
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>What about areas like maternal and child health, infectious diseases, or reproductive health?</p>
   </div>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What are your thoughts about the role of public health and public health workers in climate change—what should the public health community—inside and outside of government public health agencies—be doing about climate change? If you had lots of resources, in an ideal world, what would public health be doing around climate change?</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Do you think that we should be striving to get everyone in public health engaged in climate change, or do you think we should focus on building expertise in a smaller more focused group of public health workers, or both? Do you have any thoughts about reaching out to workers engaged in direct service – like public health nurses, or restaurant inspectors or WIC workers about climate change, and whether they could or should have a role in climate change work?</p>
