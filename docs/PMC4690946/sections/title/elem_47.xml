    <p>To discover how PH can more successfully engage with the non-PH sector working on CC to increase effectiveness of action.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C1. Introduction</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thank you for agreeing to meet with me/us. We are working with the Public Health Institute Center for Public Health and Climate Change on a project funded by the Kresge Foundation. We see climate change as one of the greatest health and equity challenges of the 21st century, and we also see that many climate action strategies could have very positive impacts on health. The goal of this project is to find out how to make it easier for the public health community to work on climate change and strengthen partnerships between public health workers and others who are working on climate change. We also want to know how public health could help others working on climate change to bring a stronger health frame to their work. We are starting by speaking to people in public health, climate change, equity, planning, environmental justice, and other fields, to learn more about their work and get their ideas on what would be helpful.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Everything you tell me will be kept confidential, unless we specifically ask for your permission to quote you. I‘ll be taking notes, but only my co-investigator and I will have access to them. You should feel free at any time to ask me questions concerning the interview or the project, or to decline to answer a question. Do you have any questions? OK, let’s get started.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It will help to define what we mean by public health and climate change up front.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We’re defining “public health” broadly to include the “upstream” or social, environmental and physical determinants of health, such as asthma from air pollution, housing conditions, education, income, access to healthy foods and transportation, 
   <span class="italic">etc</span>. When we talk about “public health workers” or “public health organizations”, we are talking about people both inside and outside of government that are working on any aspect of trying to improve population and community health.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When we talk about the impacts of climate change on health, we’re talking about both direct impacts like extreme heat, indirect impacts like rising food prices from drought, and the health effects of various strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as decreased air pollution from higher fuel efficiency. Also, this project is focused more on the US than on international issues, even though we understand that the global impacts are very significant.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, can you tell me a little about the work you do and your organization does, especially that relates to climate change?

     <p>What issues does your organization work on?</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Can you talk about how you see the links between climate and health and equity, either in terms of the impacts of climate change itself, or how climate mitigation and adaptation strategies might affect health or equity? Are you familiar with the concept of co-benefits? Co-benefits are strategies to prevent further climatic changes that also have a beneficial effect on health and quality of life.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Do you have any stories or examples of whether they are aware or concerned about the impacts of climate change on health?</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In your experience, what are some of the challenges in talking to people in your community about climate change? Do you talk explicitly about climate change, or do you start from some different framing? If so, what/how? Do you ever/often talk about the links between climate change and health? Explore.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Why do you think the general public is not more concerned about climate change?</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Do you see opportunities for getting people more engaged in climate change action and strategies through the use of a health frame? Are there any ways that using a health frame might either help or hinder your own efforts around climate change, or things we should be careful about as we try to engage more people in climate change using a health frame?</p>
