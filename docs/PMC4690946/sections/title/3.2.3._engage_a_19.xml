 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2.3. Engage and Mobilize Health Professionals and Impacted Communities with a Health Frame</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Respondents engaged with climate change from within public health and non-public health said that there was a need for a larger movement on climate change. Across groups, but particularly in the “Non-PH” group, respondents felt that 
  <span class="italic">“the public health sector has a lead role to play”</span> in facilitating this magnitude of change. As a first step, several respondents suggested that public health needed mobilization from within the field. They suggested a coordinated, funded strategy that convenes the public health sector, aligns their various work to address climate change, and facilitates a larger health movement for climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Foundations were seen as having a significant role in facilitating this movement by coordinating funding streams and creating a collective impact approach for work at the intersection of climate and health. Some respondents referenced the sense of urgency, strategy, and unity of purpose when foundations set priorities and aligned funding streams around place-based health and obesity prevention; seemingly unrelated public health activities across a range of issues now appeared to be integral parts of a strategic movement with a purpose and vision. The foundations provided the leadership, and public health leadership followed suit.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, “Non-PH” respondents held that “
  <span class="italic">There is a vacuum in the government in communicating with the public, and public health should claim that as its area.”</span> They would like to see health-framed communications about climate change and its health impacts, and strongly believed that the public health sector has the credibility and connection to communities that could be used to mobilize public support for health-protective action on climate change. One respondent who had experience framing climate change as a public health issue in political campaigns noted that public health: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“
    <span class="italic">…was the motherhood &amp; apple pie of that (political campaign). Our opponents couldn’t criticize or devalue them as a messenger. They were a messenger beyond reproach, with a message beyond reproach”.</span>
   </p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“Non-PH” participants wanted public health to use this “
  <span class="italic">heft</span>” more to change public discourse around climate change: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“There is a lot of messaging that the public health community could do, to create an environment where policy can thrive. We have pushback from conservative movements. People who are wavering and on the fence, don’t take time to read science, they can hear a public health voice more than a planner or politician.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, some “Non-PH” respondents noted the need for a more coherent public health communications strategy on climate change, grounded in better research and lessons from prior successful social norms change campaigns 
  <span class="italic">“that have moved a whole population, be it Mothers Against Drunk Driving or Anti-Tobacco, and that really changed the social fabric and the way people think about things and what they’re willing to do.”</span> Theserespondents suggested that public health could provide a unifying frame linking climate change, health, environmental justice, social justice, and equity, and supporting an integrated approach. “
  <span class="italic">There is good work happening in silos, but the community needs a more cohesive vision to move forward and health might provide that cohesion.”</span> Some respondents felt that public health messaging could ground “climate change” framing, in that: 
  <span class="italic">“Public health makes climate change real for these communities.”</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, respondents across groups believed that public health could partner more strategically with climate change organizers to engage, partner with, and mobilize communities most impacted by climate change. Many noted that public health agencies already work with these communities, and that public health workers can work with community members to identify and define climate and health problems, and ensure that climate solutions do not negatively impact disadvantaged communities. One climate change organizer stated, 
  <span class="italic">“Human rights and health have narrative power…It’s a great litmus test for most policy proposals.”</span> Another noted: “
  <span class="italic">Every municipality in the city is working on climate action planning. We can be at every one of those… and health can get us there, connect grassroots groups to each other so there is something to mobilize for. We haven’t had that meta-frame.”</span>
