  <span class="italic">Lack of Leadership: Risk Aversion and Politicization of Climate Change</span> 
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, across all groups there was a high level of consensus and frustration that public health leadership on climate change is sorely lacking. Strengthening leadership amongst the executive leaders 
  <span class="italic">of mitigating climate change, just raising their voices more in the public.”</span> who define priorities and allocate resources was identified as a crucial step. “PH engaged” participants voiced frustration with the absence of public health agency leadership and action on climate change: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“Public health should be speaking out more on the importance of addressing climate change”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When asked why this was not happening, participants linked this to politicization, lack of higher-level institutional support, overt pressure to not act, and fear of repercussions in a risk-averse culture.One governmental “PH engaged” said working on climate change depends on “
  <span class="italic">if they have the leadership, vision, or leeway to get into things elected officials are going to slap them down for.”</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Those “PH non-engaged” who saw connections in their work to climate change expressed reluctance to make the links explicit based on perceived political constraints. In jurisdictions where leaders dispute that climate change is real or human-caused, there is fear about even mentioning the words “climate change”, as expressed by a “PH non-engaged”: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“In a public health department like this, the legislation controls your budget, and if there are legislators who feel in any way threatened by interventions, you could find yourself not getting funding for different things.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, participants from all groups believe the lack of public health leadership on climate change is exacerbated by a risk-averse culture in public health. One “PH engaged” governmental employee noted: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“Some other parts of the government are less risk averse, but ours is more so… Their whole thing is that ‘we don’t want any surprises and everything goes through us’. Anything that causes anyone to be upset, they shy away from it.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another “PH engaged” respondent said: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“They need to know the Board of Supervisors (BOS) won’t fire them if they speak out on climate change…. Not until people are at the end of their careers will they say what needs to be said.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Significantly, public health respondents from both groups indicated that the politicization of climate change and the risk aversion limiting public health involvement impacts their ability to fulfill basic roles, such as stating the likely health effects of policies being considered or the health conditions in their community that may be related to climate change.</p>
