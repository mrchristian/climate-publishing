 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our research adds a more nuanced examination of the barriers and opportunities for increasing public health sector work addressing climate change. Strengths include an in-depth qualitative assessment and the inclusion of groups with different perspectives on the issue, particularly those who are not engaged with climate change. The research is limited by the fact that the sample was not representative of public health professionals, either in level of engagement on climate change or geographically. The predominance of California respondents could skew results to reflect the state’s broad support for aggressive action on climate change. Within California, 58% of the respondents were from the politically progressive San Francisco Bay Area, further skewing results to reflect support for action on climate change. Our sample did not include any public health professionals from other states who are not engaged with climate change; follow up studies should investigate involvement with climate change in this target group. It is also worth noting that the majority of the public health professionals not engaged in climate change were in executive positions; further research should investigate this subgroup since many interviewees believed that organizational leaders were a crucial group to engage. Finally, further studies could investigate public health academics who are not engaged in climate change. As thought leaders and trainers for the next generation of public health professionals, they are an important subgroup to engage.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This research suggests that there are many opportunities for the public health sector to become more engaged in work that addresses climate change, but that broader engagement will progress slowly without more explicit strategies to improve public health sector understanding of the issue, address institutional barriers, build leadership, and shift public health practice and funding towards root causes of climate change and poor health.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.1. Education and Communications for the Public Health Sector</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In prior surveys of public health professionals, the majority of participants recognized that climate change impacts health. Many of the public health professionals we interviewed do not know or understand much about climate change and health nor believe they have adequate information to engage on the issue. Participants also did not appear to appreciate the interconnections between health, inequities, and climate change impacts and opportunities [
   <a rid="B38-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-12-15010">38</a>]. Although our research preceded the last National Climate Assessment and the release of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, there has been a growing body of evidence that climate change will affect health since the late 1980s, and more recent literature on the health co-benefits of climate action. A concerted effort is clearly needed to reach public health practitioners with this information in a way that fosters greater engagement and self-efficacy. More specific forecasting of the local health impacts of climate change may reduce the perception that climate change is so distant in time and place as not to pose any urgent challenge to public health.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Respondents from outside of the public health sector strongly articulated the potential value of the public health voice in communications to help catalyze public opinion to support more robust climate action. Because health education and communications are a routine component of virtually all public health programs, support for integration of climate change into public health messages could serve as a relatively easy first step to increased engagement.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.2. Target Public Health Institutional Barriers</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our research indicates the persistence of deficits in funding, leadership, knowledge, and workforce capacity found in previous surveys [
   <a rid="B27-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-12-15010">27</a>]. Some of these persistent deficits in public health institutional capacity may be attributable to barriers from within the field of public health (e.g., insular practice, conflict aversion, or siloed training), while others are likely shaped by institutional constraints from outside of public health.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, the political controversy about the science of climate change appears to significantly influence the willingness of public health professionals to speak publicly about climate change as a significant public health issue. Even among respondents who clearly understood the issue, felt the urgency, and saw relationships between their work and climate change, few felt comfortable making the links explicit and were reluctant to take public leadership on the issue. Given the extent of local and state focus on climate change in California, however, the fact that so many of our respondents still expressed hesitancy about talking about climate change is notable.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Public health staff’s mission is to protect and promote the public’s health. Yet they are aware of and fearful about the potential consequences of being vocal about climate change when those with power over budgets and jobs disavow it. It is unknown whether increased awareness of the general public’s level of concern and desire for government action on climate change [
   <a rid="B39-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-12-15010">39</a>] and the view of those in other sectors that health professionals can play a critical role on this issue could counter the impacts of politicization. Public health has a history of action on other politicized health issues, such as HIV/AIDS, needle exchange, and reproductive health, largely in the context of social movements around those issues. This data indicates that when governmental public health staff are constrained due to politicization, strong partnerships with non-governmental organizations and “inside-outside” strategies are needed to advance climate change and public health nexus work.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.3. Build Leadership</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effective leadership will be required to significantly shift public health practice to fully address climate change. Strong leadership could leverage formal and informal authority to educate the public and inform policy even in the absence of statutory mandates or significant new funding. Not every local health department or health organization will have charismatic leaders; training and support are needed to cultivate and develop the leadership necessary to face a challenge of this magnitude.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">California and Federal climate change policies cite the health benefits of such policies, but often do not provide the formal authority, leadership, requirements to work with public health, or funding to public health agencies in creation or implementation of those policies. Future research should investigate effective use of informal authority, and creative use of legal authority avenues that now exist. For example, the National Environmental Policy Act and the California Environmental Quality Act (NEPA/CEQA) require many public agencies to analyze and disclose potentially significant environmental effects of agency actions, including effects on human health. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) required under these laws may be an opportunity for improving integration of human health concerns within the EIA process for climate-specific planning [
   <a rid="B40-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-12-15010">40</a>], and partnering with public agencies that do have authority to support and improve health.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.4. Work on Root Causes of Climate Change and Poor Health</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The way that agencies and programs are funded and organized within public health presents a significant barrier because addressing climate change requires work on multiple systems that both cause climate change and public health problems. Unfortunately due to norms of practice within the field and bureaucratic and political constraints from larger systems, work on climate change within health tends towards a narrow framework for practice, limited capacity due to a decimated public health infrastructure, funding, and workforce expertise, lack of formal power and informal leadership, and compartmentalization within public health and in most other governmental agencies necessary for effective partnership in forming systemic solutions.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Work that addresses the determinants of both health inequities and climate change provides perhaps the best opportunity to improve those systems that cause climate change, poor health, and inequities through myriad pathways. Failure to make explicit the links between community health promotion, health equity, and climate change mitigation and adaptation represents missed opportunities to inform and activate citizens to demand more action on climate change, and to inform decision-makers about opportunities to optimize health and equity or minimize harms. For example, while hundreds of municipalities around the nation are developing climate action plans, few are explicitly engaging or integrating health and equity, thus missing opportunities to prevent harms and optimize health and equity co-benefits [
   <a rid="B41-ijerph-12-15010" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-12-15010">41</a>]. The lessons we learn from work at the nexus of climate change and health are useful to understanding how to advance other work on social determinants of health. As respondents described in the barriers section, public health practice that remains focused on a biomedical model will miss those opportunities.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.5. Coordinate and Shift Funding</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resource limitations have forced public health agencies into a reactive mode, responsive to one immediate health crisis after the next. Disinvestment in the public health infrastructure has thus weakened the ability of public health agencies to respond proactively to a slow-moving public health emergency such as climate change or address the determinants of climate change and health. Significant reinvestments in the public health infrastructure will be necessary in order to absorb the increasing impacts on health of climate change, and to enable conceptualization, organization, and practice that proactively optimize health and equity benefits from climate change work.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mentioned in the results, respondents identified a number of strategic and creative ways to use existing funding. The fact that interviewees working on climate change outside of public health saw important and immediate roles for the public health sector supports the idea that inter-sectoral collaborations—for example the Health in All Policies approach—might incorporate more explicit linkages with climate change mitigation and resilience. Health and equity considerations could be integrated more explicitly into climate change program planning and policy development. Governmental and private funders could more explicitly permit or encourage integration of climate change, wherever relevant, in currently funded programs. Finally, foundations are setting the agenda for powerful movements around health, and these respondents are hungry for such a movement in public health for climate change.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the challenges, our respondents identified an array of promising initiatives that provide hope that, as the magnitude of the climate change threat to health becomes ever more apparent, the public health sector will find ways to engage on the issue.</p>
