 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Mediterranean climate is characterized by a hot and dry season in summer and mild temperatures associated with rainfall in winter. Despite the apparent uniformity of the Mediterranean climate, there are differences between sub-areas, for example in the length of the dry season or a variance in precipitation amounts [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-13-00438">1</a>]. The Mediterranean climate type is found in five areas of the world including the Mediterranean Basin, the western United States (California) and Mexico (northwest Baja), central Chile, the Cape region of South Africa, and south and southwestern Australia [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-13-00438">2</a>]. These five areas are renowned for high levels of biological richness [

  <a rid="B4-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-13-00438">4</a>]. The mild Mediterranean climate and the proximity to the sea make it attractive to people, resulting in a disproportionately high conversion of ecosystems for agriculture, development, and other human uses. As a result, the Mediterranean climate regions are characterized by high population density and growth, as well as the extension of urban areas [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the Mediterranean climate is determined by the interaction between mid-latitude and sub-tropical circulation regimes and a complex morphology of mountain chains and land–sea contrasts, the Med-regions are vulnerable to climatic changes [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-13-00438">7</a>,
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-13-00438">8</a>]. In fact, the Mediterranean ecosystems are among the most vulnerable to the global warming impacts [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-13-00438">9</a>]. Recent studies show that these changes have already been observed: for instance, since the 1960s, the Mediterranean basin has become warmer with a significant increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves. It is also characterized by a reduction in the availability of potable water as a result of a decrease in the total amount of precipitation, changes in rainfall patterns and water overuse by the growing population, mainly in urban areas [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-13-00438">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-13-00438">11</a>]. In California the mean temperature has increased across all regions [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-13-00438">12</a>], and projected average temperatures are expected to rise dramatically in future decades, greatly exceeding the warming that has occurred to date since the late 19th century [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-13-00438">13</a>]. In recent years, California has experienced extreme drought [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-13-00438">14</a>]. According to Williams 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-13-00438">15</a>] anthropogenic warming has intensified the recent droughts as part of a chronic drying trend that is becoming increasingly detectable and is projected to continue growing throughout the rest of this century. In the Western Cape region of South Africa significant warming trends were found and very warm days have become warmer or have occurred more regularly [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-13-00438">16</a>]. Under climate change projections, serious reductions in water supply and increases in the frequency of intense wildfires are expected for this region [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-13-00438">17</a>]. In southwestern Australia, the mean temperature has risen by more than 1 °C since 1910 and declines in rainfall have been observed in recent decades [
