 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our understanding of ecological processes and the dynamic nature of ecosystems has expanded tremendously over the past 100+ years since the early work of Cowles, Clements, Gleason, and Tansley (Hagen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">1992</a>). For example, we no longer consider natural communities as superorganisms (Gleason 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">1926</a>); we recognize ecosystems as dynamic and succession as typically non-linear (Pickett et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">1987</a>), and we acknowledge that “[climate] stationarity is dead” (Milly et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This last idea (Milly et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2008</a>) deserves further thought. Climate is a fundamental driver of ecological processes and species distribution and abundance patterns on the landscape. Recent human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, long residence times of these gases in the atmosphere, and our current emissions trajectory suggest that the magnitude of future climate change will be substantial (Wigley 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2005</a>; Peters et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2013</a>; Hansen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2013</a>) and thus ecological processes and species patterns will change significantly. Furthermore, anthropogenic climate change is not an episodic disturbance after which conditions return to a previous state; it is a combination of directional shifts in baseline conditions (e.g., increasing mean temperatures) and changes in extreme events (e.g., more frequent and intense storms and droughts). Viewed from a paleoecological perspective, the North American landscape has changed continuously with changes in climate (Davis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">1983</a>). Just as species responded individually to these changes with differing migration rates and pathways across the continent in the past (Davis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">1983</a>; Williams et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2004</a>), current suites of species will disassemble and new, transient community types will form (Hobbs et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2009</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2010</a>). Thus, in conservation areas—many of which were initially established to protect the biodiversity patterns present on the landscape (Groves et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2002</a>)—preserving historical patterns of structure, composition, and location of natural communities over the coming decades and centuries is an unrealistic expectation.
