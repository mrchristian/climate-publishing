 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study we have presented an analysis of the association between dengue incidence and climatic variables in Mexico. We then used the model generated to make projections about the impact of future climate change on dengue incidence. For this work we brought together one of the longest (276 months of dengue reports) and more spatially diverse (nine major climatic regions across ∼2 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) dengue and climate datasets yet assembled. We furthermore used an analytic approach (Generalized Additive Modelling) that is specifically designed to analyse data when the impact of the predictors on the outcome variables are nonlinear. GAMs coupled with penalized estimation provide a more flexible modelling approach than conventional regression methods, allowing the specification of flexible functional forms with the degree of non-linearity estimated directly from the data 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Wood1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Wood1">[21]</a>. This characteristic of GAMs resolves the subtle task of determining the model flexibility a priori

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We showed that weather significantly influences dengue incidence in Mexico. However, all these relationships are highly nonlinear. Tmin
  <sub>1∶2</sub> has the biggest impact on dengue with almost zero risk below 5°C, a modest increased risk above this temperature, and a rapid increasing risk when average minimum temperatures rise above 18°C. The sharp increase in dengue incidence at minimum temperatures beyond 18°C provides a partial explanation for the strong seasonality observed in tropical provinces where seasonal variations in temperature are not greater than a few degrees 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Focks1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Focks1">[39]</a>. These effects are consistent with the biology of both the dengue vector and the dengue virus because rising temperatures shorten the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of the virus, as well as the development time and the gonotrophic cycle of the mosquito resulting in an increased likelihood of dengue transmission 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Jansen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Jansen1">[8]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Focks1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Focks1">[39]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Watts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Watts1">[40]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maximum temperature also has an effect independently from Tmin. The risk of dengue increases as Tmax
  <sub>1∶2</sub> rises above about 20°C to a peak around 32°C after which the risk declines. The decay in the response of dengue to high levels of Tmax
  <sub>1∶2</sub> may be explained by the maximum transmission efficiency of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span> achieved above 32°C 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Watts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Watts1">[40]</a>, and by adult mosquitoes gradually dying at temperatures above 36°C 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Focks1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Focks1">[39]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is also an increasing risk as Precipitation
  <sub>1∶2</sub> rises to about 550 mm beyond which risk declines. The progressive increase in dengue incidence at low Precipitation
  <sub>1∶2</sub> levels suggests the creation of rain-filled (outdoors) breeding sites, whereas the decay observed at high levels, may be due to the wash-out of such breeding sites 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Gage1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Gage1">[37]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings regarding the impact of weather on dengue risk are consistent with the results of other studies using empirical modelling (for example, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Sriprom1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Sriprom1">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Earnest1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Earnest1">[41]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Gomes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Gomes1">[42]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Karim1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Karim1">[43]</a>). However, previous studies using OLS, GLM, or ARIMA methods are unlikely to have fully captured the nonlinearities that we have demonstrated. Also, because of the larger database over more climate zones, we have been able to model these relationships over the whole range of climate variations likely to be seen under future climate change. Our results should therefore be generalizable to other regions and climatic zones and provide a better basis for modelling the impact of future climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also of interest is the significant association between dengue incidence and the proportion of the population with access to piped water. This finding is at odds with previous observations suggesting that piped water supply was protective 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Schmidt1">[15]</a>. Schmidt and colleagues suggested that dengue risk was higher in people without access to piped water supply because of the need to store water, and mosquitoes could then breed in this stored water. However, paradoxically they showed that people using rainwater harvesting had the lowest adjusted risk, and one would expect these people to store most water. It may be that in Mexico people reliant on piped water have intermittent water delivery making water storage necessary, hence providing mosquito breeding sites. The relationship between water supply and dengue risk is not simple and may differ from one locality to another.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We project an increase of up to ∼40% in dengue incidence in Mexico by 2080 due to climate change, holding the other driving factors constant. These estimations were computed considering the projected changes in monthly mean temperature and precipitation. Downscaled projections on the intensity and variability of rainy events in Mexico are, to our knowledge, currently unavailable at this point in time.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the number of cases reported each year in the dataset, this would equate to about 7,000 extra cases reported each year. However, actual excess disease burden will be greater than this value would suggest. Previous research has shown that for every official dengue report included in surveillance, there are 10—27 cases unreported 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Meltzer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Meltzer1">[44]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Clark1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Clark1">[45]</a>. Consequently, the real increase may be of the order of 70,000 to 189,000 extra cases per year. In addition, there may be many more asymptomatic infections. There is an even bigger concern in that this increase in infections, both symptomatic and asymptomatic may increase the incidence of the more severe forms of dengue. Previous research in the field has demonstrated that secondary infection with a new serotype increases the risk of severe dengue (see for example 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Wearing1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Wearing1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Fox1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Fox1">[46]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Wichmann1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Wichmann1">[47]</a>). Therefore, if dengue incidence increases under climate change, the severe-dengue∶dengue ratio may potentially increase.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although our projections suggest that dengue incidence may increase in the long run, they have been computed to show the potential impact of climate change on dengue incidence whilst holding the other driving forces constant. Therefore, the projected increasing trends in dengue incidence may be different in the presence of adaptation strategies (e.g. changes in water storage technologies, as well as water supply practices and systems) to alleviate the adverse effects of climate change. The assessment of this hypothesis is beyond the scope of this study.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we have reported on the association between dengue incidence in Mexico and climate variables using one of the longest and more spatially diverse dengue and climate datasets yet assembled. We argue that our results provide a much improved empirical model of the relationship between the dengue and climate than has been presented to date, because of the much longer data set and the use of GAM regression to better model the nonlinear nature of the relationships. Such an improved model is critical to help make better estimations of the impact of climate change on dengue into the future. Consequently, we further argue that this dataset can be used to draw conclusions about the relationship between dengue and weather regions with similar climatic and socioeconomic features. We have estimated the impact that future climate change will increase dengue incidence by about 40%, but that the proportional increase in severe dengue forms may be greater.</p>
