 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained the province-specific monthly mean values of minimum temperature, average maximum temperature and monthly accumulated precipitation from the Mexican National Meteorological Service for each province for the period 1971—2007. These monthly mean values were computed using province-specific observations from all available meteorological stations across Mexico. The network of meteorological stations from the National Meteorological Service consists of over 2,000 stations distributed across the whole country. The frequency and duration of rainy events were not considered as such information was not available from the National Meteorological Service. We preferred station data over satellite data because meteorological stations seem to provide more reliable information about the conditions (particularly rainfall) of an area than do satellites

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the modulating effects of the climate system on vector populations do not immediately result in changes on dengue transmission, we specified meteorological variables within biologically and physically plausible time lags based on literature reports in Mexico (for example, references

  <a rid="pntd.0002503-HurtadoDaz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-HurtadoDaz1">[27]</a>), and considering the delays in laboratory confirmation of suspected cases and their reporting. Optimal lags for the climatic variables comprised monthly average minimum temperature, average monthly maximum temperature and accumulated monthly precipitation lagged one and two months. Due to significant autocorrelation between the lags of these variables (Spearman's rank rho 0.7), we created new variables (Tmin
  <sub>1∶2</sub>, Tmax
  <sub>1∶2</sub>, and Precipitation
  <sub>1∶2</sub>) taking the mean of the values of the two optimal lags.
