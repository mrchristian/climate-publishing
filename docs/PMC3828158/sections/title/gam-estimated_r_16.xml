 <p>The figure shows the GAM estimated relationships between average monthly dengue incidence and (A) Tmin
  <sub>1∶2</sub>, (B) Tmax
  <sub>1∶2</sub>, (C) Precipitation
  <sub>1∶2</sub>, and (D) the proportion of the population with access to piped water. Solid lines indicate the average expected number of dengue cases (cases/100,000 people per month); dashed lines indicate the estimated 95% Bayesian estimation confidence intervals.
