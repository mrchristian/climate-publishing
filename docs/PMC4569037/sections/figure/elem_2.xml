  <p>Spatial distribution of common reed (
   <span class="italic">Phragmites australis</span>) stands identified in four St. Lawrence River sectors by remote sensing images (2010) and modeled spatial distribution of germination grounds suitable for the species that have not yet been invaded, for three climate scenarios (COMP: the present-day climate 1961–1989; WAWE: warmer and wetter climate predicted for 2040–2069; WADR: warmer and drier climate predicted for 2040–2069). Germination grounds vulnerable to a common reed invasion are cumulated for the time period considered.
