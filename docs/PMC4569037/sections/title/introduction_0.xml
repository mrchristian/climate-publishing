 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change and the introduction of invasive species are major threats to biodiversity. The synergy of these two drivers of change will probably affect some ecosystems more than others, such as wetlands, where fluctuating water levels have a high influence on the composition and distribution of plant assemblages (van der Valk et al. 
  <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">1994</a>; Casanova and Brock 
  <a rid="b12" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12">2000</a>; Hudon 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2004</a>; Webb et al. 
  <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2012</a>). Climate warming over the next few decades will likely affect the timing, distribution, frequency, and duration of floods. This will especially be true for the St. Lawrence–Great Lakes hydrographic system, one of the most important waterways in North America. The water supply from the Great Lakes could significantly drop in the near future because of high evaporation levels during winter due to a lack of extended ice cover (Croley 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2003</a>). Water levels of the St. Lawrence River could consequently fall by as much as 80–100 cm (Croley 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2003</a>; Fagherazzi et al. 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2005</a>; Morin et al. 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2009</a>). A change of this magnitude to the hydrologic regime could foster the spread of several invasive wetland plants following the exposure of large germination grounds (Hudon 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2004</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The common reed (
  <span class="italic">Phragmites australis</span> (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.), considered to be the most invasive plant in the marshes of northeastern North America (Lelong et al. 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2007</a>; Tulbure and Johnston 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2010</a>; Kettenring et al. 
  <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">2012</a>), will likely flourish under the new conditions created by climate change. The exotic haplotype M (Saltonstall et al. 
  <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">2004</a>) was introduced along the St. Lawrence River approximately 100 years ago (Lelong et al. 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2007</a>). Populations were fairly rare until the 1960s and 1970s, and were primarily found along the river. Since the 1980s, they have spread inland in Québec and Ontario (Canada) as a result of the road network development, as adjacent drainage ditches provide very good habitat for the plant (Lelong et al. 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2007</a>; Jodoin et al. 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2008</a>). Although reedbeds do not cover very large areas in the St. Lawrence River wetlands, recent surveys indicated that the situation is rapidly changing: in some marshes, the invaded area has more than doubled since the beginning of the 2000s (G. Létourneau, unpubl. data).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies have shown that in freshwater wetlands, prolonged periods of soil surface exposure foster the establishment of new common reed populations and their subsequent spread through vegetative propagation (Hudon et al. 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2005</a>; Whyte et al. 
  <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2008</a>; Tulbure and Johnston 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2010</a>; Wilcox 
  <a rid="b87" ref-type="bibr" href="#b87">2012</a>). These new populations are essentially created through the germination of a few seeds (Belzile et al. 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2010</a>; McCormick et al. 
  <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2010</a>; Kettenring et al. 
  <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2011</a>; Kirk et al. 
  <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">2011</a>; Albert et al. 
  <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2015</a>). Seed germination occurs on wet (nonflooded) soils devoid of vegetation (Weisner and Ekstam 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">1993</a>; Coops and Van der Velde 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">1995</a>; Tulbure and Johnston 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2010</a>). Reedbeds generally form dense patches with stems reaching approximately 4 m in height (Gagnon Lupien et al. 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2015</a>). The yearly biomass produced by the plant results in a thick layer of litter that decomposes slowly (van der Valk et al. 
  <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">1991</a>; Warren et al. 
  <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">2001</a>; Windham 
  <a rid="b89" ref-type="bibr" href="#b89">2001</a>). The accumulation of organic matter alters sediment dynamics, creating a build-up of vegetation that reduces water flow, changes topography, and plays a role in the gradual drying of invaded marshes (Windham and Lathrop 
  <a rid="b90" ref-type="bibr" href="#b90">1999</a>; Rooth et al. 
  <a rid="b71" ref-type="bibr" href="#b71">2003</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whereas the negative effects of a common reed invasion on native flora are tangible and well documented (Keller 
  <a rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" href="#b39">2000</a>; Meyerson et al. 
  <a rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58">2000</a>; Lavoie et al. 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2003</a>), its impacts on fish and wildlife are not as clear. Although faunal assemblages in brackishwater marshes are significantly affected by the presence of the common reed (Dibble et al. 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2013</a>), freshwater fish (Larochelle et al. 
  <a rid="b45" ref-type="bibr" href="#b45">2015</a>), amphibian (Mazerolle et al. 
  <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2014</a>), and bird assemblages (Meyer et al. 
  <a rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57">2010</a>; Gagnon Lupien et al. 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2015</a>) do not appear to be strongly disturbed by the invader. It is nevertheless possible that the number and extent of common reed populations in freshwater marshes have not yet reached a threshold beyond which adverse effects on biodiversity become more important (Gagnon Lupien et al. 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2015</a>). This hypothesis remains to be tested, but a model predicting the distribution of the common reed under climate change scenarios would be extremely useful for evaluating the risk to wetland biodiversity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The specific objectives of this study were to develop a model enabling us to map the distribution of potential germination grounds for the common reed in the St. Lawrence River wetlands under current climate conditions and then use this model to predict their future distribution under two climate change scenarios simulated for 2050. We hypothesized a significant increase in the area that could potentially be occupied by common reed stands in 2050, particularly in Lake St. Pierre, a shallow widening of the river with more than 16,000 ha of wetlands, in which common reed stands are, for the moment, relatively uncommon.</p>
