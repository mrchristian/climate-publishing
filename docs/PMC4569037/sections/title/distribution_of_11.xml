 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2010, common reed stands covered 212 ha in the entire study area, as revealed by the satellite images. Common reed covered 40 ha in Lake St. Louis, 86 ha in the Boucherville Islands (by far the most invaded sector), 34 ha in the Contrecœur Islands, and 52 ha in Lake St. Pierre, respectively. Mean common reed stand size was 14 m
  <span class="sup">2</span> for the entire study area. In the Lake St. Pierre sector, it was only 3 m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, near the spatial resolution limit of pixels from the satellite images used. In Lake St. Pierre, 41% of common reed stands were small (≤10 m
  <span class="sup">2</span>), while in the other sectors, they were larger and in most cases ≥50 m
  <span class="sup">2</span> (69% of reed stands in the Boucherville and Contrecœur Islands, and 57% in Lake St. Louis, respectively). Field mapping validation showed an increase in interpretation accuracy with common reed stand size. Small stands (≤10 m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) had a greater margin of error (21% were incorrectly identified) than medium (11–50 m
  <span class="sup">2</span>; 6%) and large (≥51 m
  <span class="sup">2</span>; 4%) stands. Overall, for all sectors and common reed stand sizes combined, the species identification at the stand level was correct in 88% of the cases. Reed canary grass and cattails (
  <span class="italic">Typha</span> spp.) were the other plant species involved in identification errors.
