 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model which identified, on an annual basis, polygons from the IERM grid with potential for common reed seed germination and seedling survival, performed best using three parameters, that is, (1) temperature; (2) water level; and (3) wetland class. However, it is important to note that water level had a much greater influence on the model performance than the two other parameters combined. Removing these two parameters had virtually no impact on the model performance (0.05% decline in overall rate of correct classification). Nevertheless, because the three parameters collectively improved the model, they were all retained.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparing the actual distribution of common reed stands from 1980 to 2009 in the Boucherville Islands with the distribution of germination grounds produced using the model for the same period gave a correct (i.e., a stand occurred in a germination ground) classification rate of 57% (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). The model sensitivity was 87%, while its specificity was only 49%. The best overall performance for the entire study area was in Lake St. Louis (65%). For all sectors, the model sensitivity clearly outperformed its specificity; for example, sensitivity reached 97% in the Contrecœur Islands, compared to 49% for specificity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approximately 62% of the polygons identified as germination grounds for the common reed in the Boucherville Islands, but containing no reed (according to the analysis of satellite images taken in 2010) and visited for validation purposes in 2012, contained at least one new reed stand. These new stands were generally small with only a few stems not connected to nearby stands; as a result, they were not detected on the 2010 satellite images, either due to their small size or because they were initiated in 2011 or 2012. The model performance increased considerably once these new small stands were included: The rate of correct classification for the validated subsector of the Boucherville Islands increased from 59% to 75%.</p>
