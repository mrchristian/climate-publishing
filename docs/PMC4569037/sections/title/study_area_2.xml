  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>), from Lake St. Louis (45°19′N; 73°56′W) to Lake St. Pierre (46°16′N; 72°38′W). The St. Lawrence River flow is fed by the Great Lakes and Ottawa River watersheds, which drain an area of 917,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. Variations in river flow can largely be attributed to fluctuations in precipitation. However, the Moses-Saunders Dam (Cornwall, Ontario) regulates the flow to minimize extreme fluctuations in water level, both along the Great Lakes and the river. Spring floods normally increase water flow in Lake St. Pierre to 13,000 m

Overall, wetlands of the St. Lawrence River are made up by high marshes (55% of the total surface area), low marshes (26%), and swamps (19%; Létourneau and Jean
