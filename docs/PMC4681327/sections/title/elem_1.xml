 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent rapid regional warming along the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) has driven massive loss of ice shelves and retreat of tidewater glaciers, together with a reduction of seasonal sea-ice extension (

   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). Surface waters at the Western AP have warmed by almost 1°C in the latter half century and strong surface salinity changes, especially in coastal areas during summer (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). Biological responses are increasingly being predicted from single species to ecosystem levels, including changes in abundance, diversity, and assemblage structure (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>). However, shifts have been reported particularly in the pelagic system, in phytoplankton with cross-food web links from krill to penguins (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). Although by far most Antarctic species occur in the benthos, to date observed responses from abundant and diverse communities on the seabed have been restricted to only a few species (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>). Most of the reported shifts in benthic species were related to catastrophic events, such as ice-shelf collapses, or to the colonization of newly ice-free areas (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>). Whereas only one taxon, bryozoans, was reported to be affected by the gradual change of a factor driven by climatic change, exhibiting a linear relationship with the increment of ice disturbance (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>), major effects at the community level remain unknown (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In polar areas, temperature rise is often predicted to be the pervasive factor, for example, the still controversial colonization of spider crabs, which could severely affect shelf benthic communities by a top-down control that was absent in these ecosystems for millions of years (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>). Therefore, most work has been devoted to analyzing temperature effects using physiological and ecological approaches (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>). However, in the short term, cascading effects such as ice scouring action and the increased sedimentation caused by glacier retreat seem to be influencing coastal benthos more significantly than temperature directly. Sedimentation effects on community structure or species performance have recently received attention (

  </a>–
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">

  </a>), which is probably due to the proximity of scientific research stations to glacier termini.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecosystem response to climate change is the most pressing issue in future Antarctic research (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>), and because of the relative constancy of environmental variables, slow growth rates, and population turnover (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>), Antarctic benthic ecosystems can be considered good sentinels for monitoring effects of climate change. The scarce knowledge of most Antarctic areas and especially the present lack of established baselines against which to assess change could be responsible for the paucity of recorded biotic effects of the AP warming. Thus, there is likely an underestimate of current responses in Antarctic benthos.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we carried out a long-term study of a benthic ecosystem in an Antarctic fjord (Potter Cove, King George/25 de Mayo Island, and South Shetland Islands; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). We focused on megabenthic assemblage structure and observed major shifts over 15 years. We relate these shifts to factors driven by the recent rapid regional climate change, and the physiological traits of species either particularly sensitive or rather resistant to such changes, by integrating physiological and ecological approaches.

Rectangles are sampling stations with their depth sampling profiles, 15, 20, 25, and 30 m. The Inner Station (I) is most exposed to sediments carried by (a) Potter and (b) Matías creeks. M, Middle Station; O, Outer Station. Inner and Middle stations are located in the inner cove (c), sheltered from the entrance of big icebergs by a sill at 26- to 28-m depth (d; red dashed line). Outer Station is in the outer cove (e). (c) PO3 sediment core location (bathymetry of Potter Cove shown in fig. S1).</p>
