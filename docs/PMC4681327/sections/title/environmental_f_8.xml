 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the last two decades, concentrations of SPM increased significantly in the inner Potter Cove (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>), with mean values increasing from 7.5 mg liter
  <span class="sup">−1</span> to ca. 15 mg liter
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. In contrast, no significant changes of SPM concentrations were observed at a hydrographic monitoring station close to our outer station (
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>). Maximum monthly mean values, measured since 1991, peaked in 1997 to 1998, then decreased and peaked again in 2008 to 2009 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>). SPM and sediment accumulation at Potter Cove are mainly driven by meltwater runoff from the retreating Fourcade Glacier (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>). In the adjacent Maxwell Bay, where Potter Cove is tributary, mass accumulation rates of bulk sediment (MAR
  <sub>BS</sub>) have tripled since the 1940s (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
   <span class="italic">36</span>
  </a>). Consistently, MAR
  <sub>BS</sub> estimations based on 
  <span class="sup">210</span>Pb analyses obtained from a sediment core sample (PO3) in the inner Potter Cove (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>) indicated a continuous increase of sediment accumulation since 1900, and MAR
  <sub>BS</sub> values around 1995 were three times those measured near 1900 and the highest registered so far (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> and fig. S3). Both SPM and MAR
  <sub>BS</sub> data sets provide evidence for a sedimentation maximum between 1995 and 1998, which was between our first two photographic surveys. However, the second peak in SPM of 2008 to 2009 was not reflected in the MAR
  <sub>BS</sub>. These differences can be caused by parameters such as wind speed and wind direction, determining that most of the sediments can be either transported outside the cove or deposited on the bottom. The second SPM peak signal was lacking in the MAR
  <sub>BS</sub> data, probably indicating that most of these sediments were carried out from the Inner cove by the prevailing currents and therefore affecting seabed organisms to a lesser extent. Moreover, MAR
  <sub>BS</sub> data set integrated the accumulation of sediments on the bottom over longer time periods, offering a closer perspective on benthic fauna than SPM.
