 <div class="title">Species coverage and sediments at Potter Cove.</div>
 <p>Percentage cover of the different taxa at the Inner Station and at 25- to 30-m depth of the Middle Station, the areas that showed marked shifts in benthic communities at Potter Cove (see details for all the stations and depths in fig. S2). At the Inner Station, trends of decreasing abundance in ascidians and increased pennatulids, sponges, and mobile taxa are visible. Note that at 30-m depth, there are less taxa present in 1998 than in 1994 or 2010. The Middle Station exhibited a shift from macroalgal to zoobenthic dominance, particularly pennatulids, sponges, and ascidians. In 1998, only transects at 20- and 30-m depths were sampled. The lower part of the graph shows mass accumulation rates of bulk sediments (MAR
  <sub>BS</sub>), total suspended particulate matter (SPM), and percentage of organic matter (OM) in the time lapse of the benthic surveys. MAR
  <sub>BS</sub> and SPM peaked between 1994 and 1998 (gray shadow bar, which could be a threshold for this ecosystem), and the MAR
  <sub>BS</sub> values were also the highest registered during the last century (see fig. S3).
