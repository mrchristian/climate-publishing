  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Photographic surveys were performed during the summer seasons of 1994, 1998, and 2010. Pictures were taken with a Nikonos V camera, using a 15-mm lens and a Nikonos SB-104 strobe in 1994 and 1998 and a Sony SR12 Digital Camera in 2010. The cameras were mounted on an aluminum frame of 50 × 50 cm, allowing quantitative estimations of densities (ind m
   <span class="sup">2</span>) and coverage of identifiable taxa (&gt;1 cm). At each station, photographs were taken by SCUBA diving following particular depth profiles of 15, 20, 25, and 30 m. Areas shallower than 15 m were not sampled because they were almost devoid of epifauna due to ice action, and deeper waters were not accessible by SCUBA diving due to dive regulations. For the analyses, at least 50 pictures of each depth and station were processed and the same procedure was used in each survey.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Images were analyzed first by counting all the individuals of the taxa present, except for colonial forms (that is, sponges or bryozoans) and macroalgae, and then the percentage cover of all taxa was estimated, superposing a grid of 100 dots randomly distributed on the image.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Raw data of percentage cover obtained from photo-transects were square root–transformed to down-weigh the influence of the most dominant taxa, and then a similarity matrix was constructed using the Bray-Curtis similarity distance. Three multivariate procedures were applied on the basis of the similarity matrix. In the first term and to visualize changes in species composition and assemblage structure across stations, depths, and time, an indirect ordination analysis, nMDS, was used. Then, for testing spatial differences and temporal changes in surveyed assemblages, an ANOSIM was used. This analysis provides a test statistic 
   <span class="italic">R</span> that varies between −1 and 1, the zero value representing the null hypothesis of no differences among a set of samples. Values between 0 and −1 are unlikely as they would indicate higher dissimilarity among replicates within a sample than with replicates from different samples. Generally, 
   <span class="italic">R</span> lies between zero and l, representing the magnitude by which samples differ (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total SPM was measured gravimetrically after filtering 0.25 to 2 liters of seawater through combusted preweighed 25-mm Whatman GF/F filters. After filtration, filters were rinsed twice with distilled water to remove sea salt, then dried for 24 hours at 60°C, and weighed again. Filters were then burned at 500°C for 4 hours to obtain the ash-free dry mass to estimate the content of organic matter. Samples were taken monthly since 1992 at two stations in Potter Cove [see details by Schloss (
    <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
     <span class="italic">34</span>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <span class="sup">210</span>Pb analyses were carried out for five samples obtained from a 34-cm-long sediment core (PC/P03), which was obtained in the inner Potter Cove (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). Activities of radionuclides (
    <span class="sup">210</span>Pb, 
    <span class="sup">214</span>Pb, and 
    <span class="sup">214</span>Bi) were measured by γ-spectrometry (Ge-detector, GWC 2522-7500 SL, Canberra Industries Inc.) and processed with Genie 2000 3.0 (Canberra Industries Inc.). Counting statistics showed a lack of precision lower than 5% for the samples except those with very low 
    <span class="sup">210</span>Pb activity (&lt;0.08 Bq g
    <span class="sup">−1</span>). The accuracy of this method was tested by using a standard reference material similar in matrix composition to the sediment samples (UREM-11) and was better than 10% for all radioisotope concentrations. To take account of changing sedimentation rates with time, the age of each sediment slice and mass accumulation rates of bulk sediments (MAR
    <sub>BS</sub>) were determined according to the constant flux model of Sanchez-Cabeza and Ruiz-Fernández (
    <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">

    <span class="sup">210</span>Pb excess data were calculated by the difference of the total 
    <span class="sup">210</span>Pb activity and the supported 
    <span class="sup">210</span>Pb flux, which is given by the average of 
    <span class="sup">214</span>Pb and
