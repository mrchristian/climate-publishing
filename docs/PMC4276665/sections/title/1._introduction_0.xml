 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change has been identified as the biggest global health threat of the 21st century [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-11-13097">1</a>]. In Canada, climate change is expected to pose greater health risks to Canadians from increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events (e.g., more heat events of longer duration [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-11-13097">2</a>], floods, droughts, wildfires andstorm surges), poor air quality, impacts on drinking and recreational water quality, food-borne diseases and vector-borne and zoonotic diseases [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-11-13097">2</a>,
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-11-13097">3</a>]. Health care facilities play a critical role in reducing health impacts from climate change by treating illnesses and injuries attributable, at least in part, to climate-related hazards, caring for patients during and after disasters [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-11-13097">4</a>] and actively participating in community efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-11-13097">5</a>]. Health care pressures in communities will increase with climate change and are expected to occur coincident with important socio-economic changes (e.g., ageing population, increased urbanization) and environmental degradation that can further increase health risks in populations and demands on health care facilities [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-11-13097">6</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A changing climate threatens the quality and continuity of care provided at health care facilities due to more frequent and severe extreme weather events and increased health risks from a range of other climate hazards including food-, water-, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases and poor air quality. Health care facilities will become increasingly vulnerable to impacts from climate change without adaptation [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-11-13097">2</a>]. For example, extreme weather events can lead to public health emergencies which can overwhelm health care facility capacity, disrupt services, and damage facility infrastructure which can subsequently pose health risks to patients and staff [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-11-13097">4</a>,
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-11-13097">7</a>]. In many regions, more extreme heat events and generally warmer summers are expected to increase heat-related illnesses and exacerbate chronic diseases [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-11-13097">1</a>,
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-11-13097">8</a>]. Studies have linked extreme heat events with increased health care facility visits [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-11-13097">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-11-13097">10</a>] and similar correlations have been made with poor air quality days [
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-11-13097">11</a>,
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-11-13097">12</a>]. Health care facilities are highly dependent on critical community services (e.g., electricity, clean drinking water, food service delivery, waste disposal and treatment) that are vulnerable to power disruptions as evidenced by recent events in Canada [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-11-13097">13</a>] and internationally [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-11-13097">14</a>,
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-11-13097">15</a>]. Health care facility officials may have a false sense of security that critical services will be available in emergencies which may not be the case with changing weather patterns due to climate change [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-11-13097">14</a>,
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-11-13097">16</a>]. Risks of critical infrastructure loss from flooding events are expected to rise with climate change and health care facilities will need to adapt systems accordingly. Health professionals will need to be better trained and equipped to diagnose and treat new and emerging diseases and to respond to a wider range of climate-related public health emergencies. Costs and unforeseen expenses associated with climate change impacts may exacerbate existing financial challenges and strain functional capacity of health care systems at the community level [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-11-13097">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Health care facilities in developed nations, like Canada, are not immune to climate change impacts. Recent climate-related disasters in Canada, the United States, Australia and Europe have highlighted challenges in disaster preparedness associated with climate hazards. The Alberta floods (2013), Hurricane Sandy (2013), Hurricane Juan in Nova Scotia (2003), Hurricane Katrina (2002), and the ice storm in Eastern Canada (1998) created unexpected challenges for health care facilities that exceeded coping capacity in some cases. Challenges included damage to infrastructures, limited access to essential services, increased patient loads, and issues with maintaining supply chains, such as essential drugs. The 1998 ice storm led to widespread power outages and surges of patients at hospitals with a wide range of injuries and acute illnesses such as fractures, hemorrhages, hypothermia, and carbon monoxide poisoning. Many health facilities were called upon to provide shelter for persons without power at home and critical supplies to other hospitals [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-11-13097">18</a>]. Some studies have highlighted the need to bolster health care facility emergency preparedness in Canada [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-11-13097">19</a>,
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-11-13097">20</a>,
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-11-13097">21</a>], further highlighting the need to improve disaster resiliency to prepare for a changing climate. Knowledge of the impacts of climate change on the health care sector is increasing [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-11-13097">1</a>,
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-11-13097">22</a>,
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-11-13097">23</a>]; however, guidance for developing comprehensive adaptation strategies for health systems is needed [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-11-13097">4</a>,
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-11-13097">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Information exists to support efforts by health care facilities to prepare for climate change but guidance is piecemeal. For example, Blashki provides examples of adaptations to climate change hazards for health systems that are included in Australia’s National Adaptation Research Plan [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-11-13097">24</a>]. Hiete 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. provide strategies to reduce a health care facility’s vulnerability to power outages and VanVactor outlines recommendations for ensuring supply chain management processes are resilient in emergencies [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-11-13097">16</a>,
  <a rid="B25-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-11-13097">25</a>]. Health care facilities contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions through the energy intensive 24 h operation of services and to environmental degradation through the high demand of health care services and operations on natural resources (energy, water, and food procurement) [
  <a rid="B26-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-11-13097">26</a>,
  <a rid="B27-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-11-13097">27</a>]. As such, tools are available to help health care facilities reduce their environmental footprint [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-11-13097">5</a>,
  <a rid="B26-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-11-13097">26</a>,
  <a rid="B28-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-11-13097">28</a>]. A lack of a coherent and integrated approach to adaptation results in preparedness gaps that can leave some health care facilities and surrounding communities vulnerable. Furthermore, no climate change resiliency tool has been developed and tested in Canada and tailored to the needs of facilities in the country.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Health care facilities need a comprehensive tool to support climate change resiliency. This paper describes the methods undertaken to produce a climate change resiliency assessment toolkit for use by health care facility officials. The toolkit consists of: (1) a checklist for officials who work in areas of emergency management, facilities management and health care services and supply chain management; (2) a facilitator’s guide for administering the checklist; and (3) a resource guidebook to inform adaptation. The facilitator’s guide provides an overview of climate change impacts on health and on health care facilities, information for officials on how to complete the assessment checklist and suggestions on how to adapt using the assessment results and information from the resource guidebook. A project lead within the health care facility can use the facilitator’s guide to aid officials in completing the checklist and in identification of needed adaptation strategies. The methodology used to develop the toolkit, a description of the resiliency indicators used to develop the checklist and recommendations for operationalization of the toolkit in Canada and internationally are discussed below.</p>
