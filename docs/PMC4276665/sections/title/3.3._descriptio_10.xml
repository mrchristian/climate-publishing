 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The health care facility resiliency toolkit includes an assessment checklist, a facilitator’s guide and a resource guidebook. The checklist has 82 questions within four broad areas: general information (n = 4), assessing climate-related risks (n = 19), risk management (n = 45) and building capacity to adapt to climate change (n = 14). The checklist provides a qualitative assessment of resiliency by posing questions with possible responses of “Yes”, “No”, “Somewhat, Sometimes”, “I don’t know” or “Not Applicable”. All questions include a comments box where other pertinent information, such as gaps in knowledge and data, roles and responsibilities and status of activities can be recorded and updated during future assessments. The facilitator’s guide and the resource guide were developed in response to feedback received during pilot testing of the draft toolkit. The facilitator’s guide provides background information on climate change risks to health care facilities in Canada and instructions for health care facility officials to aid in completion of the checklist. The resource guidebook includes information highlighting effective measures that can be taken to reduce risks to the facility from climate change. The toolkit is available for download at

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The resource guidebook provides helpful resources for health care facilities to increase understanding of climate change and health risks and actions to increase resiliency. In Canada, resources are available to increase awareness of climate change risks to the health care sector. In 2008, Health Canada released a report entitled: “
  <span class="italic">Human Health in a Changing Climate: A Canadian Assessment of Vulnerabilities and Adaptive Capacity</span>” which provides information for Canadians and health authorities on climate change and health risks as well as the adaptive capacity of the health sector in Canada to manage risks [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-11-13097">2</a>]. A Government of Canada climate change impacts and adaptation assessment, released in 2014, provides updated information on climate change and health challenges in urban, rural, coastal and northern communities and innovative adaptation measures available to health sector decision makers [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-11-13097">3</a>]. The Canadian Coalition for Green Health Care provides information to help hospital officials reduce the environmental footprint of their facility and mitigate greenhouse gases [
  <a rid="B56-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-ijerph-11-13097">56</a>]. Internationally, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change produces regular assessment reports [
  <a rid="B57-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57-ijerph-11-13097">57</a>] and special reports (e.g., Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation: a Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) that includes information on climate change risks to human health. The WHO has published information about climate change and health related risks for a number of areas including extreme heat [
  <a rid="B58-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-ijerph-11-13097">58</a>], flooding, economic valuation, gender implications [
  <a rid="B59-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-ijerph-11-13097">59</a>] and innovative ways to reduce risks, for example, by linking climate services with emergency management and health care services [
  <a rid="B60-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60-ijerph-11-13097">60</a>]. Links to these resources and others are provided in the resource guidebook to facilitate its application and subsequent use to increase climate resiliency in health care facilities. Completion of the assessment checklist by a health care facility provides information on the degree to which that facility is resilient to current climate variability and future climate change based upon the indicators presented above. Identification of important gaps related to emergency management and health care services, greening of operations or supply procurement and management may be used by hospital officials to inform the implementation of needed adaptations.
