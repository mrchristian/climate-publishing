   <a rid="B34-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-11-13097">34</a>]. Standard emergency management approaches, such as all-hazards programs need to be modified to incorporate observed and projected alterations in the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme events to increase preparedness [
   <a rid="B32-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-11-13097">32</a>]. Managing risks from climate change (such as extreme weather) requires health care facilities to regularly undertake risk assessments that integrate current climate variability and future climate change [
   <a rid="B24-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-11-13097">24</a>] to support effective forward planning [
   <a rid="B31-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-11-13097">31</a>,
   <a rid="B35-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-11-13097">35</a>]. In regions found to be vulnerable to climate hazards such as floods or storm surges, adaptation efforts to increase the safety of buildings and protection of critical equipment can increase resilience [
   <a rid="B24-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-11-13097">24</a>] as can efforts to prepare for patient surges and associated pressures. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To anticipate increased health care demands and prepare accordingly, information on climate change and health vulnerabilities at the community level can be used [
   <a rid="B2-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-11-13097">2</a>]. In many urban communities in Canada, climate change will contribute to poor air quality (e.g., from wildfire smoke, smog, allergens) that can lead to increased hospital cases of asthma, COPD, acute bronchitis, chest pain and other cardio-respiratory illnesses [
   <a rid="B3-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-11-13097">3</a>,
   <a rid="B36-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-11-13097">36</a>]. Early warning systems can help increase preparedness to support the delivery of care. Health care facilities can benefit by being linked to weather alert and warning systems [
   <a rid="B37-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-11-13097">37</a>] such as heat alert and response systems (HARS) [
   <a rid="B34-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-11-13097">34</a>]; air quality alerts [
   <a rid="B38-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-11-13097">38</a>]; boiled water advisories and critical service disruption notifications to better anticipate increases in hospital visits. Many communities in Canada have adopted HARS to notify vulnerable groups, the general public and health care and community services of impending extreme heat events and to provide information on how people can protect themselves from heat-health impacts [
   <a rid="B39-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-11-13097">39</a>]. Such systems can help health care facilities be more prepared for increased heat-related hospital visits.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasing mortality from heatwaves and other extreme weather events, changes in the geographic range and incidence of climate-sensitive infectious diseases, increasing morbidity and mortality from poor air quality and other health impacts will require modification of current public health programs and training of health care providers to be prepared for patients presenting with currently unexpected climate-sensitive health outcomes [
   <a rid="B40-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-11-13097">40</a>]. As such, training programs could be enhanced to ensure adequate protection and care of patients with specialized needs (e.g., infants and children) [
   <a rid="B41-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-11-13097">41</a>]. Furthermore, information on range expansion of specific diseases acquired through national and regional assessments can be used to inform rapid testing, diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of diseases to protect health [
   <a rid="B24-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-11-13097">24</a>]. Climate-induced range expansion of the deer tick that harbors Lyme disease is occurring rapidly in Canada [

   <a rid="B43-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-11-13097">43</a>,
   <a rid="B44-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-11-13097">44</a>] and warmer weather and more precipitation events may increase the abundance of mosquito species that carry West Nile Virus [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once health care facilities have a better understanding of risks in their area, officials can create new or enhance existing protocols to improve risk management. For example, health care facilities in areas vulnerable to extreme heat should develop plans and protocols to guide actions that need to be taken during an extreme heat event (see

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Logisticians should be cognizant that more extreme weather events can increase risks of flooding at supply warehouses, damage to storage facilities, and disruption of communication lines and transportation [
   <a rid="B25-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-11-13097">25</a>] and therefore diversify suppliers and develop plans accordingly. Emergency preparedness programs could also enhance contingency plans for timely delivery of medical supplies and establish mutual aid agreements with other health care facilities to be resilient in emergencies where resources are limited [
   <a rid="B33-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-11-13097">33</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efforts to support community resilience to climate change should be implemented in addition to regular health care facility risk management processes. Some communities are undertaking climate change and health vulnerability assessments [
   <a rid="B47-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-11-13097">47</a>]; health care facility officials can participate in these efforts to support the identification of community level vulnerabilities and contribute to better estimates of health system adaptive capacity. Health care facilities also could participate in disaster risk management exercises to promote coordination and collaboration during a real event. Real time reporting of climate-sensitive health outcomes can help public health agencies take action to prevent public health emergencies [
   <a rid="B48-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-11-13097">48</a>,
   <a rid="B49-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-11-13097">49</a>]. Syndromic surveillance of health outcomes attributable to extreme heat or other climate hazards using hospital visits or other health information systems (e.g., health help lines, clinician visits) can support public health programs such as monitoring and providing early warning of impacts, informing and improving the public health response to climate hazards. It also provides a source of morbidity data to use in the process of continually assessing, evaluating and improving health programs [
   <a rid="B18-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-11-13097">18</a>,
   <a rid="B49-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-11-13097">49</a>]. As one example, the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control is involved in efforts to link health care facility syndromic surveillance with air quality issues from wildfire smoke and extreme heat events. The system will better equip public health officials with information needed to target key vulnerable groups.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most infrastructure was built under the assumption that the weather in the next few decades will be similar to the weather today. As a result, some critical infrastructure, such as health care facilities are located in flood plains and along coastal regions that are at risk of inundation [
   <a rid="B40-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-11-13097">40</a>]. As such, health care facilities may need to take steps to make infrastructure more resilient to climate change. Robust facility structural elements (e.g., roofs, doors, windows) and non-structural components (e.g., computers, diagnostic equipment, HVAC systems, back-up generators) need to be able to withstand extreme weather events that may cause acute or gradual damage, and/or may need to be moved above possible floodwaters. Regular maintenance, prioritizing replacement of old equipment and use of new and emerging technologies to mitigate the effects of such events can reduce vulnerability [
   <a rid="B14-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-11-13097">14</a>,
   <a rid="B50-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-11-13097">50</a>]. For example, health care facilities in drought prone regions that may be vulnerable to future water shortages can install storm water collection systems, design landscapes with drought resistant native plants, and conserve water by using appropriate low flow taps, nozzles and toilets. Health care facilities can increase their resiliency to extreme heat events by installing devices and equipment for monitoring indoor temperatures, cooling existing buildings and outdoor spaces, blocking direct sun, and increasing air flow and reducing humidity [
   <a rid="B39-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-11-13097">39</a>,
   <a rid="B50-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-11-13097">50</a>]. In addition, encouraging sustainability practices, such as turning off equipment when not in use, has shown to be a cost effective [
   <a rid="B28-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-11-13097">28</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Energy supply systems in many communities are vulnerable to more frequent and severe extreme weather events and other pressures such as increased demand from population growth. Back-up power sources and strategies to deal with long lasting electricity disruptions will better prepare health care facilities for emergencies and disasters. In addition to disrupting patient care, power-outages can affect patient identification and records, access to clinical care, the demand for services, communication systems, and transportation to and from the health care facilities [
   <a rid="B14-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-11-13097">14</a>,
   <a rid="B16-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-11-13097">16</a>] and increase risks of infectious diseases [
   <a rid="B51-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-11-13097">51</a>]. Back-up generators should be tested and protected to ensure they are functional in an extreme weather event [
   <a rid="B35-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-11-13097">35</a>] and use of combined heat and power systems as a replacement for back-up generators should be evaluated. In cases where power is limited during disruptions, electricity should be re-directed to clinical areas to meet needs of vulnerable patients [
   <a rid="B14-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-11-13097">14</a>]. Plans and protocols for managing outcomes of power-outages, such as mandatory evacuation, should be developed, reviewed, and tested regularly to ensure that effective measures are in place to continue to provide high quality health care when electricity is limited.

   <a rid="B53-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-ijerph-11-13097">53</a>]. Health care facilities can improve energy efficiency and save energy costs by using low energy lighting, boilers and electrical systems, increasing reliance on natural ventilation, promoting active transportation and the use of energy efficient vehicles, providing distant counseling services and using green procurement (e.g., purchasing local food) [
   <a rid="B5-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-11-13097">5</a>,

E-health, which includes electronic methods of information exchange among health care professionals and patients (e.g., use of email delivery of diagnostic results), can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from patient commuters; however, backup plans should be developed to address unreliable power or energy supplies [
   <a rid="B55-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-11-13097">55</a>]. Greening health care facility properties (e.g., planting trees, grass and gardens) offers multiple health co-benefits such as the provision of natural shade for patients, staff and visitors during extreme heat events, reduced risk of facility flooding through the creation of natural flood water infiltration and the improvement of air quality by filtering pollutants [
   <a rid="B28-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-11-13097">28</a>]. Installation of high performance windows and exceeding minimum insulation requirements can also improve energy efficiency and enhance the comfort and safety of patients during extreme temperature events [
