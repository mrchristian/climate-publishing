 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Canadian federal health adaptation initiatives emphasize capacity building and information type initiatives, addressing infectious diseases, heat-related risks or general health risks (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-00623-f002" href="#ijerph-12-00623-f002">Figure 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-00623-f003" href="#ijerph-12-00623-f003">Figure 3</a>). Contributing to the large number of capacity building initiatives is a series of heat risk guidelines and guidebooks prepared by Health Canada for public health officials, emergency management officials, health care workers and health administrators [

  <a rid="B68-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-ijerph-12-00623">68</a>]. Meanwhile, most information initiatives reflect research conducted by the Public Health Agency of Canada that focuses on food and water safety and vector-borne diseases [
  <a rid="B69-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69-ijerph-12-00623">69</a>]. Both Health Canada and Natural Resources Canada have completed national vulnerability assessments (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ijerph-12-00623-s002" href="#ijerph-12-00623-s002">Appendix D in Supplementary Material</a> for descriptions of federal departments) [

  <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-00623">23</a>]. Some of these health adaptation initiatives were implemented as part of the multi-departmental Adaptation Theme of the federal government’s Clean Air Agenda. Canada’s Federal Adaptation Policy Framework does not discuss any specific adaptation initiatives. The continuation and further expansion of health adaptation programs and funding availability depend on the priorities of individual departments and upper-level government. A list of all federal, provincial, territorial and municipal adaptation initiatives by type is shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-00623-t002" href="#ijerph-12-00623-t002">Table 2</a>, and an Excel spreadsheet detailing all discrete adaptation initiatives is available in in the

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of federal health adaptation initiatives reflect groundwork initiatives, preparing the conditions for adaptive action. These groundwork initiatives include guidebooks, decision-making toolkits, vulnerability assessments and research. Federal adaptation 
  <span class="italic">actions</span> (as opposed to groundwork initiatives) are primarily alert and response systems to air quality, infectious diseases and heat event risks. Half of the federal adaptation initiatives reviewed explicitly state consideration of vulnerable groups, particularly those addressing heat-related health risks.
