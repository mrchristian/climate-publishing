 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on our analysis of publically available information, Quebec emerged as the leader in provincial and territorial health adaptation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-00623-f006" href="#ijerph-12-00623-f006">Figure 6</a>). The province has a comprehensive climate change adaptation plan with a detailed health section, addresses most regional health risks and has a diverse assortment of adaptation types. Quebec is bolstered by being home and partner to Ouranos, a consortium on regional climatology and adaptation practitioners, which contributes to the knowledge base on impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation in the province. Similar to the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Program (UKCIP), Ouranos functions as a boundary organization that seeks to bridge science and policy to increase engagement of decision-makers, build adaptive capacity and create a network of knowledge [
  <a rid="B74-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74-ijerph-12-00623">74</a>]; such boundary organizations have been identified as an important component of institutional development for promoting readiness for adaptation [

  <a rid="B75-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75-ijerph-12-00623">75</a>]. Ouranos emerged in response to several extreme weather events (1998 ice storm and 2000 flooding in Quebec, and the European heat wave in 2003) which incited support for climate change research [

  <span class="italic">et al.</span> suggest adaptation to the health impacts of climate change in Quebec is taking place because of stable financing (money from the provinceâ€™s carbon tax funds its climate change action plan), willingness for transdisciplinary collaboration, openness to public health innovation, and the knowledge provided by Ouranos on the current and projected impact of climate change in the province [

    <span class="sup">a</span> The provinces and territories have been ranked qualitatively by number of health adaptation initiatives, percentage of regional health risks addressed, having a climate change adaptation plan, and the quality of the adaptation plan. See

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-00623-f006" href="#ijerph-12-00623-f006">Figure 6</a> shows the level of health adaptation in Canadian provinces and territories ranked qualitatively by number of initiatives found online, addressing identified regional health risks, having an adaptation plan with a health section, level of detail, and availability of climate change information on health department websites. A middle-pack of provinces and territories emerges, consisting of New Brunswick, Newfoundland &amp; Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, and Ontario. These provinces and territories each report implementing three to six health adaptation initiatives, but vary in levels of detail, comprehensiveness and risks addressed. Lastly, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, and Yukon have each reported three or fewer health adaptation initiatives independently (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have jointly implemented three initiatives), address few or none of the identified regional health risks, and provide limited detail.
