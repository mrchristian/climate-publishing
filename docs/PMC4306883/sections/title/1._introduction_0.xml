 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change has been identified as a major risk to human health [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-12-00623">1</a>]. Climate-related health risks are already evident in events such as the 2003 European heat wave and flooding in Alberta, Canada in 2013, and demonstrate that high income countries such as Canada will be affected by the health effects of climate change [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-00623">2</a>,
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-12-00623">3</a>]. In light of the risks posed by climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls for greater global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-00623">4</a>]. Yet, as the recent IPCC Fifth Assessment Report highlights, some degree of climate change and associated health impacts are inevitable, increasing the importance of adaptation [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-12-00623">5</a>]. Adaptation refers to policies, measures and strategies designed to reduce climate change impacts and support resilience [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-12-00623">6</a>], and in a health context is synonymous with prevention (
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, it seeks to prevent/minimize impacts), and may involve primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-12-00623">7</a>,
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-00623">8</a>,
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-00623">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-12-00623">10</a>]. While numerous opportunities for adaptation in a health context exist, managing the effects of climate change on human health has nevertheless been identified as a formidable challenge for both policy makers and health professionals [
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-12-00623">11</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alongside changing precipitation patterns, the annual average surface temperature over Canada’s landmass has increased by 1.7 °C since 1948, a rate almost twice the global average, and by even more in Northern Canada, which is experiencing the most rapid climate change globally [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-00623">12</a>,
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-00623">13</a>]. The health impacts of climate change affect Canadians through both direct exposures, such as injuries and death from extreme heat events, and through indirect exposures, for example by creating favourable conditions for outbreaks of infectious diseases or by negatively impacting socioeconomic conditions. Some health impacts will be felt throughout Canada, while others will be concentrated in certain regions [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-00623">14</a>]. Climate change will benefit Canadians’ health in some ways also, for instance by reducing cold-related mortality and providing economic benefits in some sectors, but overall the health burden is expected to increase [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-12-00623">5</a>,
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-12-00623">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The approach of various levels of government in Canada to adaptation has been described as a “multi-level mosaic”, loosely connected and emerging spontaneously [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-12-00623">16</a>]. Responsibility for adaptation remains unclear and is divided between the federal government, its 10 provinces and 3 territories [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-12-00623">16</a>]. The Government of Canada published the Federal Adaptation Policy Framework in 2011 which outlines the federal role in adaptation (generating and sharing information; building adaptive capacity; and mainstreaming adaptation policies) and provides criteria for federal departments and agencies to consider when identifying climate change adaptation priorities [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-00623">17</a>]. This framework is valuable and an important development, but does not identify how the federal government will work with other levels of government and does not suggest a direction for Canada as a whole to take in adapting to climate change, outside of the federal government; in the general scholarship, these have been identified as important components of government planning for adaptation [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-12-00623">18</a>,
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-12-00623">19</a>,
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-12-00623">20</a>]. Some climate change effects will be felt in localized areas of Canada, meaning much adaptation will also need to be implemented by municipal governments [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-12-00623">21</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the importance of adaptation in a public health context, to our knowledge there has not been a systematic examination of the current state of health adaptation across Canada. Health Canada and Natural Resources Canada, departments of the federal government, have conducted comprehensive vulnerability assessments which outline some examples of adaptation [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-00623">14</a>,
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-12-00623">22</a>,
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-00623">23</a>]. However, these assessments were not designed to characterize and compare adaptations at different jurisdictions, across regions, and over time. Reflecting this, in this study we systematically review Canadian health adaptation at the federal, provincial, territorial and local levels, examine their jurisdictional patterning, and outline gaps in health adaptation. Developing an understanding of how health adaptation is currently taking place in Canada, the work provides a baseline for future monitoring of adaptation progress. We begin the paper by outlining the risks posed by climate change on Canadians’ health, before presenting our methods and results.
