  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Canadian federal health adaptation initiatives emphasize capacity building and information type initiatives, addressing infectious diseases, heat-related risks or general health risks (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-00623-f002" href="#ijerph-12-00623-f002">Figure 2</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-00623-f003" href="#ijerph-12-00623-f003">Figure 3</a>). Contributing to the large number of capacity building initiatives is a series of heat risk guidelines and guidebooks prepared by Health Canada for public health officials, emergency management officials, health care workers and health administrators [
   <a rid="B66-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66-ijerph-12-00623">66</a>,

   <a rid="B68-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-ijerph-12-00623">68</a>]. Meanwhile, most information initiatives reflect research conducted by the Public Health Agency of Canada that focuses on food and water safety and vector-borne diseases [
   <a rid="B69-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69-ijerph-12-00623">69</a>]. Both Health Canada and Natural Resources Canada have completed national vulnerability assessments (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ijerph-12-00623-s002" href="#ijerph-12-00623-s002">Appendix D in Supplementary Material</a> for descriptions of federal departments) [

   <a rid="B22-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-12-00623">22</a>,
   <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-00623">23</a>]. Some of these health adaptation initiatives were implemented as part of the multi-departmental Adaptation Theme of the federal government’s Clean Air Agenda. Canada’s Federal Adaptation Policy Framework does not discuss any specific adaptation initiatives. The continuation and further expansion of health adaptation programs and funding availability depend on the priorities of individual departments and upper-level government. A list of all federal, provincial, territorial and municipal adaptation initiatives by type is shown in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-00623-t002" href="#ijerph-12-00623-t002">Table 2</a>, and an Excel spreadsheet detailing all discrete adaptation initiatives is available in in the

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of federal health adaptation initiatives reflect groundwork initiatives, preparing the conditions for adaptive action. These groundwork initiatives include guidebooks, decision-making toolkits, vulnerability assessments and research. Federal adaptation 
   <span class="italic">actions</span> (as opposed to groundwork initiatives) are primarily alert and response systems to air quality, infectious diseases and heat event risks. Half of the federal adaptation initiatives reviewed explicitly state consideration of vulnerable groups, particularly those addressing heat-related health risks.

Both are the only municipalities reviewed to include plans for monitoring and evaluation of adaptations implemented. The majority of Toronto’s health adaptation initiatives were adaptation actions that addressed extreme heat, but others addressed air quality, food safety and security, UV radiation, floods and general health vulnerabilities. Toronto’s adaptation initiatives are highly varied, including actions such as providing cooling centres during extreme heat events, and implementing a heat alert system and hot weather response plan.</p>

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-00623-f006" href="#ijerph-12-00623-f006">Figure 6</a>). The province has a comprehensive climate change adaptation plan with a detailed health section, addresses most regional health risks and has a diverse assortment of adaptation types. Quebec is bolstered by being home and partner to Ouranos, a consortium on regional climatology and adaptation practitioners, which contributes to the knowledge base on impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation in the province. Similar to the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Program (UKCIP), Ouranos functions as a boundary organization that seeks to bridge science and policy to increase engagement of decision-makers, build adaptive capacity and create a network of knowledge [
   <a rid="B74-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74-ijerph-12-00623">74</a>]; such boundary organizations have been identified as an important component of institutional development for promoting readiness for adaptation [

   <a rid="B75-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75-ijerph-12-00623">75</a>]. Ouranos emerged in response to several extreme weather events (1998 ice storm and 2000 flooding in Quebec, and the European heat wave in 2003) which incited support for climate change research [

   <span class="italic">et al.</span> suggest adaptation to the health impacts of climate change in Quebec is taking place because of stable financing (money from the province’s carbon tax funds its climate change action plan), willingness for transdisciplinary collaboration, openness to public health innovation, and the knowledge provided by Ouranos on the current and projected impact of climate change in the province [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Divergent jurisdictional strategies are important here, since an adaptation initiative successful at one scale may not be considered successful at another [
   <a rid="B77-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-12-00623">77</a>]. Federal governments are best suited to intervene with public policy on issues affecting whole populations [
   <a rid="B77-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-12-00623">77</a>]. Some Canadian federal initiatives address specifically Northern populations which fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government, as dictated by Canada’s Constitution [
   <a rid="B78-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78-ijerph-12-00623">78</a>]. Sub-national governments meanwhile are often more flexible and can make and implement decisions more quickly [
   <a rid="B79-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79-ijerph-12-00623">79</a>]. Municipal governments have impetus for adaptation, since the benefits of these adaptive actions benefit them directly, and as key actors in adaptation need climate resources and decision support [
   <a rid="B80-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80-ijerph-12-00623">80</a>]. Current health adaptation to climate change reflects the jurisdictional responsibilities for health mandated by Canada’s Constitution, and the federal government’s role in adaptation outlined in Canada’s Federal Adaptation Policy Framework [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite these trends and the need for support, the influence of higher-level governments on municipal adaptation planning and implementation is not clear based on the publically available information reviewed here. Local governments are not entirely autonomous actors in adaptation and can be assisted or constrained by higher-level governments [
   <a rid="B77-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-12-00623">77</a>,
   <a rid="B80-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80-ijerph-12-00623">80</a>]. For example, changes in Chinese municipal government adaptation agendas are heavily influenced by national government incentives [
   <a rid="B81-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81-ijerph-12-00623">81</a>]; in contrast, where federal climate change action is limited such as in the United States, local governments may have the opportunity to be more entrepreneurial, innovative and autonomous in their adaptation strategies [
   <a rid="B80-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80-ijerph-12-00623">80</a>,
   <a rid="B82-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82-ijerph-12-00623">82</a>]. Based on our review, large Canadian municipalities seem to follow the latter pattern, where some cities such as Toronto and Vancouver have committed to adaptation, while others including Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton and Calgary report doing little to nothing. Provincial adaptation also does not appear to exert a strong influence on municipal adaptation: Quebec is a leader in provincial adaptation, while Montreal, Quebec’s largest city, reported few health focused adaptations; British Columbia is a laggard among Canadian provinces, but its largest city Vancouver is progressing autonomously.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assigning responsibility to jurisdictions for managing the risks of climate change impacts and financing adaptation is a major challenge in such cross-jurisdictional issues [
   <a rid="B83-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83-ijerph-12-00623">83</a>]. In contrast to the Canadian context where the responsibility for health and environment are primarily devolved to the provinces, the adaptation responsibilities of central government are clearer in other countries with different jurisdictional structures, such as Belgium and the United Kingdom [
