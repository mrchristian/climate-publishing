 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have performed two model experiments in this study. The first model experiment was made to estimate the influence of climate change on the atmospheric transport of Hg to the Arctic and the deposition within the Arctic. This experiment was also applied to identify the major source areas of Hg to the Arctic and to study if there is a change in the importance of the different source areas in the applied climate change scenario. The second model experiment was made to estimate the effects of changes in emissions compared to the effect of changes in climate conditions. For the first experiment we made four sets of simulations, one with all sources, one with no sources in North America (NA), one with no sources in Europe (EU), and one with no sources in Asia (AS), see

  <span class="italic">i.e</span>., the contribution from the global background concentration using a simple subtraction method since all the Hg related processes in the model are linear. In these simulations, we applied the most recent global Mercury emission inventory for 2005 [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the second model experiment, we performed five sets of simulations with different future emission scenarios for the year 2020 [
  <a rid="B32-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-12-11254">32</a>], one assuming status quo emissions (SQ), one with extended emissions control (EXEC), one assuming the maximum feasible technological reduction (MFTR) and one without anthropogenic emissions (zero emission).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each set of simulations in both model experiments consists of two ten-year time slices representing present (1990–2000) and future (2090–2100) climates. A 30-year period is usually applied as a climate normal in climate studies, however, the ten-year time slices were chosen in this study to reduce the computation time and this approach has proven to be successful in several studies [

  <a rid="B27-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-12-11254">27</a>,
  <a rid="B28-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-12-11254">28</a>,
  <a rid="B31-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-12-11254">31</a>]. We have applied the same emissions to the atmosphere in each of the sets of simulations. With this set-up, the difference in predicted concentrations and depositions for each set of simulations arises only from the effect the difference in climate input has on the transport and deposition processes, and it is possible to investigate the response of DEHM to a changed climate forcing.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To drive the simulations, we have applied meteorological data from a model simulation made with the ECHAM5/MPI-OM model [

  <a rid="B35-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-12-11254">35</a>] simulating the SRES A1B scenario [
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-12-11254">36</a>]. The SRES A1B scenario projects the global average temperature to increase by ~3 °C by the end of the 21st century with large seasonal and regional differences in the warming. The average sea ice extent in the Arctic is estimated to retreat by approximately 40%, and over the Barents Sea, the sea ice is predicted to vanish completely by the end of the 21st century. The globally averaged precipitation changes only slightly, although there are large regional and seasonal differences. The winter precipitation over the temperate and arctic regions is projected to increase by 10%–50%. The global temperature change related to the SRES A1B scenario from AR4 is quite similar to the RCP6 scenario used in the IPCC AR5 [
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-12-11254">11</a>]. The SRES A1B is only one of several climate change scenarios and represents an intermediate development of the climate. This is a sensitivity analysis to investigate the response of the model system to changed climate input. One thing that should be kept in mind with the interpretation of such sensitivity analyses is that the DEHM model, as many other models, has parameterizations of processes which are tuned to the current climate in order to improve the present day model performance. The processes may change with climate conditions and the model may thus not have a reliable response to a changed climate input.
