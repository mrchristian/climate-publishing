  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main reason for the differences between the two decades in the model is that the parameterization of the fast oxidation of Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> to HgO during the AMDEs depends on the sea-ice fraction. The lower sea-ice fraction in the 2090s compared to the 1990s will result in a lower oxidation of Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> to HgO and therefore a higher concentration of Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> and lower concentrations of RGM and TPM.

   <span class="sup">o</span> N) is shown. The total deposition is 18% lower in the 2090s than in the 1990s, and the difference is statistically significant. RGM is the major component of the deposition due to a high dry deposition velocity to the surface, and the lower RGM air concentrations in the 2090s result in lower depositions.

The deposition to the continents is significantly higher in the 2090s than in the 1990s due to significantly higher ozone concentrations in the troposphere, which is one of the main oxidant paths of mercury in the DEHM model. The deposition to the Arctic Ocean is significantly lower in the 2090s than in the 1990s due the reduction in sea ice coverage.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several processes not accounted for in the DEHM model that potentially can affect the estimate of the importance of climate change for the Hg deposition within the Arctic. One process is re-volatilization from the surface. This is partly accounted for by the background concentration as described in section 2.1. It has been speculated that a reduction in sea-ice cover will lead to an enhanced re-volatilization from the Arctic Ocean, while another effect is that TPM deposited on the ice free water is less likely to re-volatilize immediately than when deposited on sea ice and snow and the combination of these two effects may be nearly neutral [
   <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-11254">13</a>]. On the other hand, the volatilization is dependent on the gradient between the concentrations in air and water, and a higher concentration of Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> in air in the 2090s combined with a larger ice-free part of the Arctic Ocean will lead to a lower re-volatilization of Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> from the surface. If re-volatilization was accounted for in the DEHM model this would have reduced the Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> concentrations in air (corresponding to a lower background concentration in the model), which would lead to lower estimated depositions to the surface. However, we estimate that this effect on the reduced oxidation to RGM and subsequent lower deposition is negligible compared to the effect of changes in sea-ice coverage.

   <a rid="B5-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-12-11254">5</a>] indicate that reactions of Hg with atomic bromine can account for the conversion of Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> to RGM during AMDEs, although the understanding of these processes is not yet complete [
   <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-11254">13</a>]. It has been suggested that higher temperatures will slow down the gas-phase oxidations and thus reduce the depositions if the present Br levels are unchanged [
   <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-11254">13</a>]. There are uncertainties regarding the origin of atmospheric Br that are associated with snow, refreezing leads and formation of first-year sea-ice [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. The Contribution from Major Source Areas</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contribution from the four different source areas: North America (NA), Europe (EU), Asia (AS), and the background (BG) is also shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f002" href="#ijerph-12-11254-f002">Figure 2</a>. For both Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> and RGM, the contribution from the global background is 64% of the total concentration in the 1990s, while Asia contributes with 25%, Europe with 6% and 5% arrives from North America. The difference in the contributions for the two decades is less than 1% for Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> and RGM, which means that the relative contribution from the source areas does not depend on the climate according to these model simulations. For particulate Hg, the contribution from the background is smaller (47% for the 1990s, 43% for the 2090s), mainly because of the transport of primary particulate Hg. Europe contributes with 17% in the 1990s and 20% in the 2090s, Asia with 30% and 31% for the two decades and North America with 6% for both decades. This indicates that the transport of primary particulate Hg, especially from Europe, is enhanced in the 2090s compared to the 1990s under the applied climate change scenario. Results from the DEHM model also indicates that the atmospheric transport of POPs to the Arctic is larger in a future warmer climate [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative contribution to the deposition is also shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f003" href="#ijerph-12-11254-f003">Figure 3</a> and these are quite similar to the relative contributions of Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> concentrations as described above, reflecting that Hg is mainly transported to the Arctic as Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> which is oxidized to RGM and particulate Hg during the transport and some of this oxidized Hg is deposited. The larger atmospheric transport of TPM in the 2090s than in the 1990s is so small compared to the Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> that it does not influence the overall relative contribution distribution. The global background is the most important contributor. There are only very small differences (&lt;0.2%) in the relative contributions for the two decades indicating that climate change do not have a large influence on the relative contribution of the source areas. All the source areas in the Northern Hemisphere contributes to a large background pool of Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> and this is getting well mixed before the Hg is deposited because of the long lifetime of Hg
   <span class="sup">0</span> in the atmosphere (1 year). However, there are some differences between the source areas in how large a fraction of the total emission that is deposited in the Arctic (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f005" href="#ijerph-12-11254-f005">Figure 5</a>). Europe is relatively the most important source area from which around 4.4% of the total Hg emission is deposited in the Arctic in the 1990s, while it is 3.3% for Asia and 3.2% for North America. This shows that the emissions from Europe are more efficiently transported to the Arctic compared to emissions from Asia and North America, which are both located more southerly and in addition have a longer transport pathway before they arrive in the Arctic. Common for all three source areas is that these fractions are lower in the 2090s compared to the 1990s (3.7%, 2.7% and 2.6% for EU, AS, and NA, respectively), corresponding to 16%–18% lower. This is due to the lower deposition owing to the lower sea-ice fraction in the 2090s than in the 1990s.

Although their division of source areas was finer than the one applied in this study and their model domain did not cover the most eastern part of the Arctic, some similarities are seen. The contribution from re-emission and natural sources (corresponding to the background in this study) accounts for an estimated two thirds of the deposition to the Canadian Arctic, while (East) Asia is the major anthropogenic source area followed by Europe and North America.

The first set of simulations is with the global Mercury inventory for 2005, three sets of simulations were with each of the 2020 emission scenarios (SQ, EXEC and MFTR), and the last set was with no anthropogenic emissions, called “zero emission”. In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f007" href="#ijerph-12-11254-f007">Figure 7</a>, the total deposition to the Arctic (a) and the relative changes compared to the 2005 basic simulation for the 1990s (b) are shown for all 10 model simulations. The MFTR results in 20% lower, the EXEC in 16% lower, while the SQ scenario results in a 6% higher total deposition in the 1990s compared to the 2005 basic emissions simulation. If the anthropogenic emissions are removed the deposition to the Arctic will be 37% lower for the 1990s. The decrease in depositions is in excellent accordance with previous model estimates using the same emission scenarios, with predictions of an increase in deposition in the Canadian part of the Arctic of approximately 5% for the SQ emission scenario and decreases in deposition of 15%–17% for the EXEC and 18%–20% for the MFTR emission scenarios [
