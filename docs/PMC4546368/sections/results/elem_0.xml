  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g001" href="#pone.0136092.g001">Fig 1</a> gives the raw and relative frequencies of the word “climate” over the study period. We calculate the relative frequencies by dividing the daily count of “climate” by the daily sum of the 50,000 most frequently used words in the gardenhose sample. From this figure, we can see that while the raw count increases over time, the relative frequency decreases over time. This decrease can either be attributed to reduced engagement on the issue since the maximum relative frequency in December 2009, during Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, or an increase in overall topic diversity of tweets as Twitter grows in popularity. The observed increase in raw count can largely be attributed to the growth of Twitter during the study period from approximately 1 million tweets per day in 2008 to approximately 500 million in 2014. In addition, demographic changes in the user population clearly led to a decrease in the relative usage of the word “climate”.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g002" href="#pone.0136092.g002">Fig 2</a> shows the average happiness of the climate tweets by day, by week, and by month during the 6 year time span. The average happiness of unfiltered tweets is shown by a dotted red line. Several high and low dates are indicated in the figure. The average happiness of tweets containing the word “climate” is consistently lower than the happiness of the entire set of tweets. Several outlier days, indicated on the figure, do have an average happiness higher than the unfiltered tweets. Upon recovering the actual tweets, we discover that on March 16, 2009, for example, the word “progress” was used 408 times in 479 overall climate tweets. “Progress” has a happiness score of 7.26, which increases the average happiness for that particular day. Increasing the time period for which the average happiness is measured (moving down the panels in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g002" href="#pone.0136092.g002">Fig 2</a>), the outlier days become less significant, and there are fewer time periods when the climate tweets are happier than the reference tweets. After averaging weekly and monthly happiness scores, we see other significant dates appearing as peaks or troughs in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g002" href="#pone.0136092.g002">Fig 2</a>. For example, the week of October 28, 2012 appears as one of the saddest weeks for climate discussion on Twitter. This is the week when Hurricane Sandy made landfall on the east coast of the U.S. For the same reason, October 2012 also appears as one of the saddest months for climate discussion.

The total average happiness of the reference text (unfiltered tweets) is 5.99 while the total average happiness of the comparison text (climate tweets) is 5.84. This change in happiness is due to the fact that many positively rated words are used less and many negatively rated words are used more when discussing the climate.

   <p>The reference text is roughly 100 billion tweets from September 2008 to July 2014. The comparison text is tweets containing the word “climate” from September 2008 to July 2014. A yellow bar indicates a word with an above average happiness score. A purple bar indicates a word with below average happiness score. A down arrow indicates that this word is used less within tweets containing the word “climate”. An up arrow indicates that this word is used more within tweets containing the word “climate”. Words on the left side of the graph are contributing to making the comparison text (climate tweets) less happy. Words on the right side of the graph are contributing to making the comparison text more happy. The small plot in the lower left corner shows how the individual words contribute to the total shift in happiness. The gray squares in the lower right corner compare the sizes of the two texts, roughly 10

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The word “love” contributes most to the change in happiness. Climate change is not typically a positive subject of discussion, and tweets do not typically profess love for it. Rather, people discuss how climate change is a “fight”, “crisis”, or a “threat”. All of these words contribute to the drop in happiness. Words such as “pollution”, “denial”, “tax”, and “war” are all negative, and are used relatively more frequently in climate tweets, contributing to the drop in happiness. The words “disaster” and “hurricane” are used more frequently in climate tweets, suggesting that the subject of climate change co-occurs with mention of natural disasters, and strong evidence exists proving Twitter is a valid indicator of real time attention to natural disasters [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref026">26</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the positive side, we see that relatively less profanity is used when discussing the climate, with the exception of the word “hell”. We also see that “heaven” is used more often. From our inspection of the tweets, it is likely that these two words appear because of a famous quote by Mark Twain: “Go to heaven for the climate and hell for the company” [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref027">27</a>]. Of the 97 non-earth related climate tweets from our 1,500 tweet sample, 8 of them referenced this quote. The word “energy” is also used more during climate discussions. This indicates that there may be a connection between energy related topics and climate related topics. As energy consumption and types of energy sources can contribute to climate change, it is not surprising to see the two topics discussed together.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the first half of our dataset, Dodds et. al. [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref019">19</a>] calculated the average happiness of tweets containing several individual keywords including “climate”. They found that tweets containing the word “climate” were, on average, similar in ambient happiness to those containing the words “no”, “rain”, “oil”, and “cold” (see Table 2 [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref019">19</a>]). In the following section, we compare the happiness score of tweets containing the word “climate” to that of 5 other climate-related keywords.
 </p>
 <sec id="sec004" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate Related Keywords</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The diction used to describe climate change attitudes on Twitter may vary by user. For example, some users may consistently use “climate change” and others may use “global warming”. There are also cohorts of users that utilize various hashtags to express their climate change opinions. In order to address this, we collected tweets containing 5 other climate related keywords to explore the variation in sentiment surrounding different types of climate related conversation. As in [
   <a rid="pone.0136092.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref025">25</a>], we choose to analyze the keywords “global warming” (5.72), “globalwarming” (5.81), “climaterealists” (5.79), “climatechange” (5.86), and “agw” (5.73, standing for “anthropogenic global warming”). Search terms lack spaces in the cases where they are climate related hashtags.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tweets including the “global warming” keyword contain more negatively rated words than tweets including “climate”. There is more profanity within these tweets and there are also more words suggesting that climate change deniers use the term “global warming” more often than “climate change”. For example, there is more usage of the words “stop”, “blame”, “freezing”, “fraud”, and “politicians” in tweets containing “global warming”. These tweets also show less frequent usage of positive words “science” and “energy”, indicating that climate change science is discussed more within tweets containing “climate”. We also see a decrease in words such as “crisis”, “bill”, “risk”, “denial”, “denying”, “disaster”, and “threat”. The positively rated words “real” and “believe” appear more in “global warming” tweets, however so does the word “don’t”, again indicating that in general, the Twitter users who who don’t acknowledge climate change use the term “global warming” more frequently than “climate change”. A study in 2011 determined that public belief in climate change can depend on whether the question uses “climate change” or “global warming” [
   <a rid="pone.0136092.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref028">28</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tweets containing the hashtag “globalwarming” also contain words indicating that this is often a hashtag used by deniers. The word contributing most to the decrease in happiness between “climate” and “globalwarming” is “fail”, possibly referencing an inaccurate interpretation of the timescale of global warming consequences during cold weather. We see an increase in negative words “fraud”, “die”, “lie”, “blame”, “lies”, and again a decrease in positive, scientific words. There is also an increase in several cold weather words including “snow”, “freezing”, “christmas”, “december”, indicating that the “globalwarming” hashtag may often be used sarcastically. Similarly, Tweets including the hashtag “climaterealists” use more words like “fraud”, “lies”, “wrong”, and “scandal” and less “fight”, “crisis”, “pollution”, “combat”, and “threat”.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hashtag “agw” represents a group that is even more so against anthropogenic climate change. We see an increase in “fraud”, “lie”, “fail”, “wrong”, “scare”, “scandal”, “conspiracy”, “crime”, “false”, and “truth”. This particular hashtag gives an increase in positive words “green” and “science”, however based on the large increase in the aforementioned negative words, we can deduce that these terms are being discussed in a negative light. The “climatechange” hashtag represents users who are believers in climate change. There is an increase in positive words “green”, “energy”, “environment”, “sea”, “oceans”, “nature”, “earth”, and “future”, indicating a discussion about the environmental impacts of climate change. There is also an increase in “pollution”, “threat”, “risk”, “hunger”, “fight”, and “problem” indicating that the “climatechange” hashtag is often used when tweeting about the fight against climate change.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the exception of the “globalwarming” hashtag, our analysis of these keywords largely agrees with what is found in [
   <a rid="pone.0136092.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref025">25</a>]. Our analysis, however, compares word frequencies within tweets containing these hashtags with word frequencies within tweets containing the word “climate”. We find that more skeptics use “global warming” in their tweets than “climate”, while it may be the case that “global warming” and “globalwarming” hashtag are also used by activists.

   </div> The first three half lives of the decay in the frequency of the word “hurricane” during hurricane Sandy are 1.57, 0.96, and 1.56 additional days. Since the decay is not exponential, these half lives are not constant. The first half life indicates that after about a day and a half, “hurricane” was already tweeted only half as often. The second half life indicates that after one more day, “hurricane” was tweeted only one fourth as often, and so on. Thus, it did not take long for the discussion of the hurricane to decrease. The half lives, however, of the word “climate” are much larger at 8.19, 22.58, and 84.85 days.
