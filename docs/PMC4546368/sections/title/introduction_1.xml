 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After decades receiving little attention from non-scientists, the impacts of climate change are now widely discussed through a variety of mediums. Originating from scientific papers, newspaper articles, and blog posts, a broad spectrum of climate change opinions, subjects, and sentiments exist. Newspaper articles often dismiss or sensationalize the effects of climate change due to journalistic biases including personalization, dramatization and a need for novelty [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref001">1</a>]. Scientific papers portray a much more realistic and consensus view of climate change. These views, however, do not receive widespread media attention due to several factors including journal paywalls, formal scientific language, and technical results that are not easy for the general public to understand [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref001">1</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the IPCC Fifth Assessment report, humans are “very likely” (90-100% probability) to be responsible for the increased warming of our planet [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref002">2</a>], and this anthropogenic global warming is responsible for certain weather extremes [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref003">3</a>]. In April 2013, 63% of Americans reported that they believe climate change is happening. This number, however, drops to 49% when asked if climate change is being caused by humans. The percentage drops again to 38% when asked if people around the world are currently being harmed by the consequences of climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref004">4</a>]. These beliefs and risk perceptions can vary by state or by county [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref005">5</a>]. By contrast, 97% of active, publishing, climate change scientists agree that “human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures” [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref006">6</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref007">7</a>]. The general public learns most of what it knows about science from the mass-media [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref008">8</a>]. Coordination among journalists, policy actors, and scientists will help to improve reporting on climate change, by engaging the general public and creating a more informed decision-making process [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref009">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One popular source of climate information that has not been heavily analyzed is social media. The Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism in January of 2009 determined that topics involving global warming are much more prominent in the new, social media [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref009">9</a>]. In the last decade, there has been a shift from the consumption of traditional mass media (newspapers and broadcast television) to the consumption of social media (blog posts, Twitter, etc.). This shift represents a switch in communications from “one-to-many” to “many-to-many” [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref009">9</a>]. Rather than a single journalist or scientist telling the public exactly what to think, social media offers a mechanism for many people of diverse backgrounds to communicate and form their own opinions. Exposure is a key aspect in transforming a social problem into a public issue [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref010">10</a>], and social media is a potential avenue where climate change issues can be initially exposed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we study the social media site Twitter, which allows its users 140 characters to communicate whatever they like within a “tweet”. Such expressions may include what individuals are thinking, doing, feeling, etc. Twitter has been used to explore a variety of social and linguistic phenomena [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref011">11</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref013">13</a>], and used as a data source to create an earthquake reporting system in Japan [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref014">14</a>], detect influenza outbreaks [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref015">15</a>], and analyze overall public health [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref016">16</a>]. An analysis of geo-tagged Twitter activity (tweets including a latitude and longitude) before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy using keywords related to the storm is given in [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref017">17</a>]. They discover that Twitter activity positively correlates with proximity to the storm and physical damage. It has also been shown that individuals affected by a natural disaster are more likely to strengthen interactions and form close-knit groups on Twitter immediately following the event [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref018">18</a>]. Twitter has also been used to examine human sentiment through analysis of variations in the specific words used by individuals. In [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref019">19</a>], Dodds et al. develop the “hedonometer”, a tool for measuring expressed happiness—positive and negative sentiment—in large-scale text corpora. Since its development, the hedonometer has been implemented in studies involving the happiness of cities and states [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref020">20</a>], the happiness of the English language as a whole [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref021">21</a>], and the relationship between individuals’ happiness and that of those they connect with [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref022">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of the topics trending on Twitter are headlines or persistent news [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref023">23</a>], making Twitter a valuable source for studying climate change opinions. For example, in [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref024">24</a>], subjective vs objective and positive vs negative tweets mentioning climate change are coded manually and analyzed over a one year time period. In [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref025">25</a>], various climate hashtags are utilized to locate pro/denialist communities on Twitter. In the present study, we apply the hedonometer to a collection of tweets containing the word “climate”. We collected roughly 1.5 million such tweets from Twitter’s gardenhose API (a random 10% of all messages) during the roughly 6 year period spanning September 14, 2008 through July 14, 2014. This time period represents the extent of our database at the time of writing. Each collected tweet contains the word “climate” at least once. We include retweets in the collection to ensure an appropriately higher weighting of messages authored by popular accounts (e.g. media, government). We apply the hedonometer to the climate tweets during different time periods and compare them to a reference set of roughly 100 billion tweets from which the climate-related tweets were filtered. We analyze highest and lowest happiness time periods using word shift graphs developed in [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref019">19</a>], and we discuss specific words contributing to each happiness score.
