  <div class="title">A word shift graph comparing the happiness of tweets containing the word “climate” to unfiltered tweets.</div>
  <p>The reference text is roughly 100 billion tweets from September 2008 to July 2014. The comparison text is tweets containing the word “climate” from September 2008 to July 2014. A yellow bar indicates a word with an above average happiness score. A purple bar indicates a word with below average happiness score. A down arrow indicates that this word is used less within tweets containing the word “climate”. An up arrow indicates that this word is used more within tweets containing the word “climate”. Words on the left side of the graph are contributing to making the comparison text (climate tweets) less happy. Words on the right side of the graph are contributing to making the comparison text more happy. The small plot in the lower left corner shows how the individual words contribute to the total shift in happiness. The gray squares in the lower right corner compare the sizes of the two texts, roughly 10
   <span class="sup">7</span> vs 10
   <span class="sup">12</span> words. The circles in the lower right corner indicate how many happy words were used more or less and how many sad words were used more or less in the comparison text.
