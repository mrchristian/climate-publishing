 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CERA/CAFOR surveys covered 35 different counties, and re-surveyed three of them on two different occasions (2011 and 2014), for a total of 38 county/occasions. Earlier work found substantial place-to-place variation [

  <a rid="pone.0138208.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0138208.t002">Table 2</a> notes these county/occasion indicators help to predict individual-level climate beliefs. An adjusted Wald test finds that the county indicators collectively have significant impacts.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Place-to-place variations can themselves be a focus of research. Studies using other dependent variables have found broad structural effects, as from unemployment or population growth rates, alongside other effects reflecting local circumstances such as the importance of coal mining in rural Kentucky or the experience of warming winters in northern New England [

This includes the CERA/CAFOR surveys where, after adjusting for the significant place-to-place variation, we find substantially the same individual effects (from
