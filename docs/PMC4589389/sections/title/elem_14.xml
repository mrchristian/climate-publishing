  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three nationwide US surveys with diverse sampling and interview methods find 52% (in 2011) or 53% (in 2012 and 2014) agreement with the scientific consensus that human activities are now changing Earth’s climate (
   <a rid="pone.0138208.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g001">Fig 1A</a>). A series of 21 statewide New Hampshire surveys over 2010 to 2015 runs a few points higher than the national surveys overall (55%). On these surveys a substantial minority (31 to 39%) concede that climate change is happening, but caused mainly by natural forces. Few (3 to 8%) say they believe climate change is not happening, or decline to express an opinion. In social, cognitive or political terms, the now/human and now/natural respondents prove distinct, whereas now/natural and not now respondents are less distinct [
   <a rid="pone.0138208.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref014">14</a>]. Survey questions that simply ask whether global warming/climate change is happening, without specifying a cause, confuse two opposing viewpoints—in effect, grouping some of the now/natural responses together with now/human.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CERA and CAFOR surveys target small and often rural clusters of counties, in regions selected for a variety of separate projects. Agreement with the scientific consensus ranges from 36 to 58% across these 11 surveys (
   <a rid="pone.0138208.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g001">Fig 1B</a>). The regions studied include growing amenity-rich or near-urban areas, others dependent on coal or oil production, and still others with declining traditional resources such as forestry. Details of local environment and society help to understand place-to-place variations in climate and other environmental perceptions [

The different surveys line up surprisingly well, with New Hampshire results a few points higher. 
   <a rid="pone.0138208.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g002">Fig 2A</a> gives a visual impression of slight upward drift, to be tested by the

   <a rid="pone.0138208.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g002">Fig 2A</a> covers a deep partisan divide (
   <a rid="pone.0138208.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g002">Fig 2B</a>). Overall around 80% of New Hampshire Democrats, 55% of Independents, and 31% of Republicans agree with the scientific consensus that climate change is happening now, caused mainly by human activities. This partisan gap is one of the largest in questions asked on our surveys. The gap is somewhat greater in New Hampshire than nationally, partly reflecting a higher proportion of college graduates who, as will be seen, tend to be most polarized on this issue. For GSS the partisan gap is just 27 points, but even that is wider than historically polarizing abortion or gun control questions asked on the same survey. Surveys using different questions suggest that partisan gaps in climate beliefs have widened over the past decade [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual-level predictors</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Political orientation and education dominate other characteristics in predicting individual responses. Moreover, politics moderates the effects of education. 
   <a rid="pone.0138208.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0138208.t002">Table 2</a> quantifies these effects in logistic regression models that predict odds of a now/human response to the climate question. For the common individual-level predictors—
   <span class="italic">age</span>, 
   <span class="italic">gender</span>, 
   <span class="italic">education</span>, political 
   <span class="italic">party</span> and 
   <span class="italic">education</span>×
   <span class="italic">party</span>—these five analyses obtain remarkably consistent results.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Age</span> effects are significant for every model except GSS, and all have odds ratios below 1, meaning that older respondents are less likely to agree with the scientific consensus. For example, an odds ratio of 0.985 (IME) indicates that the odds favoring a now/human response to the climate question are multiplied by 0.985, or decrease by 1.5%, with each one-year increase in age (if other predictors stay the same). With a 10-year increase in age, the odds are multiplied by 0.985
   <span class="sup">10</span> = 0.860, or decrease about 14%.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the CERA/CAFOR and GSP data women are significantly more likely to agree with the consensus, as shown by odds ratios above 1. The CERA/CAFOR odds ratio, 1.213, tells us that odds favoring a now/human response are about 21% higher for women than for men, other things being equal.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main effects of 
   <span class="italic">education</span>, significant across all of these models, suggest that among Independents (
   <span class="italic">party</span> = 0) the odds of belief in anthropogenic climate change increase by 20 to 25% (are multiplied by 1.202 to 1.249) with each step in 
   <span class="italic">education</span>. Significant 
   <span class="italic">education×party</span> interactions, however, indicate that the effects of education change with political party. Like the main effects of 
   <span class="italic">education</span>, the magnitude of 
   <span class="italic">education×party</span> interactions is roughly consistent (odds ratios from 0.748 to 0.850) across different datasets. Adjusted marginal plots in 
   <a rid="pone.0138208.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g003">Fig 3</a> visualize the significant interactions in terms of probability. Among Democrats and Independents, probability of a now/human response rises with education. Among Republicans, however, this probability slightly declines with education. Better-educated Democrats and Republicans thus stand farther apart.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CERA/CAFOR surveys covered 35 different counties, and re-surveyed three of them on two different occasions (2011 and 2014), for a total of 38 county/occasions. Earlier work found substantial place-to-place variation [
   <a rid="pone.0138208.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref022">22</a>], motivating our inclusion of 37 intercept dummy variables in the regression model. As 
   <a rid="pone.0138208.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0138208.t002">Table 2</a> notes these county/occasion indicators help to predict individual-level climate beliefs. An adjusted Wald test finds that the county indicators collectively have significant impacts.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Place-to-place variations can themselves be a focus of research. Studies using other dependent variables have found broad structural effects, as from unemployment or population growth rates, alongside other effects reflecting local circumstances such as the importance of coal mining in rural Kentucky or the experience of warming winters in northern New England [

This includes the CERA/CAFOR surveys where, after adjusting for the significant place-to-place variation, we find substantially the same individual effects (from

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temporal variation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The New Hampshire GSP interviews were conducted on 217 different days over 2010–2015. Temporal variation across this series of 21 surveys is much less than the spatial variation across the 11 regional CERA/CAFOR surveys, but it does display several patterns. Temperature anomalies on the interview day show a weak though significant effect on climate-change beliefs. Temperature effects prove intermittent within subsets of these data, however, marking them as not robust compared with individual and place effects.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The odds of belief in anthropogenic climate change are about 14% higher (multiplied by 1.145) in summer than winter. None of the seasonal effects are statistically significant, however. On the other hand, a slight upward trend in now/human responses, subjectively visible in 
   <a rid="pone.0138208.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g002">Fig 2A</a>, is more formally supported by a significant odds ratio for 
   <span class="italic">year</span> in predicting the individual responses (
   <a rid="pone.0138208.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0138208.t002">Table 2</a>). With each additional year, odds favoring a now/human response rise about 7% (multiplied by 1.67)—other things being equal.
