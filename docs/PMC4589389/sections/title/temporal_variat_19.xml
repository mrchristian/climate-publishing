 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The New Hampshire GSP interviews were conducted on 217 different days over 2010–2015. Temporal variation across this series of 21 surveys is much less than the spatial variation across the 11 regional CERA/CAFOR surveys, but it does display several patterns. Temperature anomalies on the interview day show a weak though significant effect on climate-change beliefs. Temperature effects prove intermittent within subsets of these data, however, marking them as not robust compared with individual and place effects.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The odds of belief in anthropogenic climate change are about 14% higher (multiplied by 1.145) in summer than winter. None of the seasonal effects are statistically significant, however. On the other hand, a slight upward trend in now/human responses, subjectively visible in 
  <a rid="pone.0138208.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g002">Fig 2A</a>, is more formally supported by a significant odds ratio for

  <a rid="pone.0138208.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0138208.t002">Table 2</a>). With each additional year, odds favoring a now/human response rise about 7% (multiplied by 1.67)—other things being equal.
