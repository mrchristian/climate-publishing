 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Political orientation and education dominate other characteristics in predicting individual responses. Moreover, politics moderates the effects of education. 
  <a rid="pone.0138208.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0138208.t002">Table 2</a> quantifies these effects in logistic regression models that predict odds of a now/human response to the climate question. For the common individual-level predictors—
  <span class="italic">age</span>, 
  <span class="italic">gender</span>, 
  <span class="italic">education</span>, political 
  <span class="italic">party</span> and 
  <span class="italic">education</span>×
  <span class="italic">party</span>—these five analyses obtain remarkably consistent results.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Age</span> effects are significant for every model except GSS, and all have odds ratios below 1, meaning that older respondents are less likely to agree with the scientific consensus. For example, an odds ratio of 0.985 (IME) indicates that the odds favoring a now/human response to the climate question are multiplied by 0.985, or decrease by 1.5%, with each one-year increase in age (if other predictors stay the same). With a 10-year increase in age, the odds are multiplied by 0.985
  <span class="sup">10</span> = 0.860, or decrease about 14%.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the CERA/CAFOR and GSP data women are significantly more likely to agree with the consensus, as shown by odds ratios above 1. The CERA/CAFOR odds ratio, 1.213, tells us that odds favoring a now/human response are about 21% higher for women than for men, other things being equal.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main effects of 
  <span class="italic">education</span>, significant across all of these models, suggest that among Independents (
  <span class="italic">party</span> = 0) the odds of belief in anthropogenic climate change increase by 20 to 25% (are multiplied by 1.202 to 1.249) with each step in 
  <span class="italic">education</span>. Significant 
  <span class="italic">education×party</span> interactions, however, indicate that the effects of education change with political party. Like the main effects of 
  <span class="italic">education</span>, the magnitude of 
  <span class="italic">education×party</span> interactions is roughly consistent (odds ratios from 0.748 to 0.850) across different datasets. Adjusted marginal plots in 
  <a rid="pone.0138208.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g003">Fig 3</a> visualize the significant interactions in terms of probability. Among Democrats and Independents, probability of a now/human response rises with education. Among Republicans, however, this probability slightly declines with education. Better-educated Democrats and Republicans thus stand farther apart.
