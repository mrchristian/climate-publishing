 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The basic climate-change question offers currency, simplicity and unambiguous interpretation—whether individuals personally agree with the central point of scientific consensus on this globally important issue. As the examples here show, the question adapts readily to diverse survey instruments, opening possibilities for temporal, geographic and social-group comparisons. One planned future application is the 2016 General Social Survey, which offers an impressive range of sociological covariates. We also expect further regional surveys along the lines of CERA and CAFOR, investigating local variations. Finally, the same climate question has proven useful at smaller scales, in the benchmark and evaluation stages of education activities that are in progress but not described here.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quarterly resolution and increasingly long run of the New Hampshire time series provides a unique platform to detect and characterize future change. To date it has shown only minor fluctuations around a slow upward drift. Seemingly large external events including an election and nearby hurricane had no detectable effects, but the possibility remains that cumulative or more extreme political, economic or climate-related events could have greater impact. With or without dramatic impacts, the series provides a monitoring system for the 
  <span class="italic">shape</span> of any changes in public acceptance—whether abrupt or gradual, ephemeral or lasting.
