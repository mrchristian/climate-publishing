 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most striking result here is the stability of public beliefs about anthropogenic climate change. That holds across different surveys (
  <a rid="pone.0138208.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g001">Fig 1A</a>) and over a five-year time span (
  <a rid="pone.0138208.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g002">Fig 2A</a>), although not across places (
  <a rid="pone.0138208.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g001">Fig 1B</a>). General stability is anchored by wide, persistent political divisions (
  <a rid="pone.0138208.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g002">Fig 2B</a>). Effects from individual age, gender, education and political party manifest as similar odds ratios on many different surveys (
  <a rid="pone.0138208.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0138208.t002">Table 2</a>). Very similar 
  <span class="italic">education</span>×
  <span class="italic">party</span> interaction effects occur in most of these surveys as well. In social research, interaction effects in multivariate models frequently prove to be sample-specific, so the degree of replication seen in 
  <a rid="pone.0138208.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g003">Fig 3</a> is extraordinary.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Political identity dominates other background characteristics in predicting individual climate-change beliefs. Politics moderate effects from education, the second-strongest predictor. Agreement with the scientific consensus increases with education among Democrats and Independents (or liberals and moderates), but stays level or declines with education among Republicans (or conservatives). Similar interactions were first tested with different climate variables in 2006 GSS data [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref027">27</a>] and subsequently replicated on other regional [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref024">24</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref028">28</a>] and nationwide [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref009">9</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref029">29</a>] surveys. Variations on this pattern include objectively-assessed science knowledge [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref030">30</a>], numeracy [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref031">31</a>] or self-assessed understanding [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref009">9</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref028">28</a>] in place of education; and measures of ideology [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref009">9</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref027">27</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref028">28</a>] or culture [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref031">31</a>] in place of political party. Some other environment-related questions exhibit interactions of the same type [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref018">18</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref019">19</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref032">32</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Common explanations for the pattern invoke greater awareness among educated individuals about the views of politicians and media they follow—the 
  <span class="italic">elite cues</span> hypothesis [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref009">9</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref033">33</a>][

  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref035">35</a>]. More educated or information-rich individuals also could be more effective in seeking out and retaining information that accords with their prejudices—as described by 
  <span class="italic">biased assimilation</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref009">9</a>][

  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref037">37</a>], 
  <span class="italic">motivated skepticism</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref038">38</a>] and related hypotheses [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref026">26</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref039">39</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref040">40</a>]. These explanations all hinge on the active, motivated acceptance/rejection of information, a major complication to the simpler 
  <span class="italic">information deficit</span> hypothesis that people express low concern about scientifically-identified problems because they lack information that scientists could provide [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref041">41</a>]. With regard to climate change many people assert that they are well informed, although their sense of understanding may come from politics rather than science [
