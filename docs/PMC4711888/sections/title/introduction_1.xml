 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theoretical and empirical evidence of the influence of anthropogenic climate change on the productivity and ecology of marine ecosystems has been witnessed globally, spanning tropical, temperate, and polar regions [

  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref004">4</a>]. Over 90 per cent of observed warming has accumulated within marine ecosystems, with sea surface temperature (SST) projected to warm between 0.6°C and 2.0°C by the end of the 21

  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref005">5</a>]. Recent studies argue that climate change and the resulting range of biological responses, such as altered species distributions [

  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref012">12</a>] and the societies that depend upon them [

  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref014">14</a>]. In particular, projected changes in fisheries catch potential [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref012">12</a>] could result in, or exacerbate, socio-economic impacts on fisheries through reduced food and economic security [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While available climate change impact assessments on marine fisheries frequently focus on large-scale commercial sectors, few efforts have been made to generate quantitative scenarios of potential effects on small-scale fisheries that exhibit social, cultural, and economic dependence on marine ecosystems. Small-scale commercial and subsistence fisheries are of critical importance to food security and poverty alleviation worldwide [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref017">17</a>]. However, these fisheries are also susceptible to climate change impacts through shifts in distributions, compositions and potential yields of fish stocks.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First Nations situated along the Pacific coast of Canada are representative of Indigenous communities whose small-scale subsistence and commercial fishing practices and diversified harvest and storage of marine resources, such as salmon, have played essential roles in the development of their cultural complexity [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref018">18</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref021">21</a>]. These Nations have demonstrated exemplary resilience in the face of anthropogenic and environmental change for millennia, having occupied this region for more than 10,000 years [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref023">23</a>]. They have therefore attained considerable experience in accommodating environmental change and interpreting ecological indicators and relationships through traditional ecological knowledge (TEK)[
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref024">24</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref027">27</a>]. However, given the intrinsic importance of marine ecosystems to coastal First Nations, as cited extensively in the archaeological and anthropological literature [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref028">28</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref031">31</a>], unprecedented climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref032">32</a>] poses a considerable threat to First Nations’ food and economic security, cultural practices, and spiritual values through fisheries [

  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref033">33</a>]. Many First Nations have noted significant climate-related impacts manifesting in decreased availability of traditional foods through declining abundances, altered growth and migration patterns, and reduced predictability previously established through TEK and traditional phenological knowledge (TPK; [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref024">24</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref035">35</a>]). Thus, it is necessary to improve our understanding of challenges that are likely to be faced increasingly by Indigenous peoples under climate change. This endeavor can be supported by identifying scenarios likely to occur under climate change, thereby allowing for the development and implementation of appropriate mitigation and/or adaptation strategies that are informed by First Nations’ TEK.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasingly, scenario-based assessments have enabled us to examine questions concerning the impacts of climate change on marine fisheries [

  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref036">36</a>]. Plausible scenarios constructed from expert knowledge have been employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to serve as a framework for investigating key questions and for engaging in discussions regarding mitigation and adaptation prospects [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref037">37</a>]. As models have been used in fisheries science as necessary tools to address uncertainty and produce defensible management strategies from existing knowledge [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref038">38</a>], the integration of climate projections with fisheries models has enabled development of useful scenarios outlining potential effects on marine ecosystems and fisheries [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies have qualitatively explored factors influencing the resilience of First Nations in British Columbia [

  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref044">44</a>], highlighted the potential application of TEK in understanding and responding to climate change [

  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref046">46</a>], and produced frameworks for assessing the vulnerability of remote Indigenous communities to climate change [

  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref048">48</a>]. This study progresses a step further by projecting plausible quantitative scenarios of how coastal First Nations’ key marine resources might be affected by climate change, identifying corresponding fisheries management challenges that would likely emerge under these scenarios, and discussing potential adaptive responses to these specific challenges informed by traditional fisheries management strategies. To achieve this, a SDM driven by outputs from global coupled ocean-atmosphere-biogeochemistry earth system models was used to project changes in potential yields of species targeted by coastal First Nations’ fisheries under climate change. With reference to these results, we discuss potential climate-resilient pathways that draw from examples of First Nations’ traditional fisheries management strategies.
