 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To the authors’ knowledge, this study offers the first attempt to develop quantitative projections of climate-related impacts on small-scale fisheries and to explore how traditional fisheries management strategies could be used to respond to specific challenges inferred from these projections. This scenario-based framework thereby provides an opportunity to proactively identify challenges that are likely to arise from climate change, with specific application to local risk assessments for small-scale, traditional fisheries.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projected declines in relative catch potential across each of the coastal First Nations’ territories under both the lower (RCP 2.6) and upper (RCP 8.5) scenarios of climate change yield three key questions that are relevant to fisheries globally under climate change: (1) how do we mitigate impacts to fisheries catch potential that are unequally distributed? (2) how do we account for the externalization of impacts to fisheries? and (3) how can we effectively implement joint-management frameworks that balance objectives? While this study presents examples of potential climate-resilient pathways that might be used to respond to these challenges in the context of coastal British Columbia, including resource sharing agreements that redistribute impacts, local mariculture operations that contribute to offsetting declines in catch potential, and joint-management frameworks that facilitate collaborative management approaches, community-based research would be an essential requirement to identify viable options that fully accommodate each community’s respective concerns and values. Findings from this study provide the foundation to guide future research to address this set of questions. While the estimates derived from this analysis are not intended to represent fisheries management guidelines, the underlying trends that emerge illustrate the value of using quantitatively derived scenarios to examine potential site-specific impacts. For instance, the latitudinal trends in declining catch potential projected in this analysis can be used to develop management strategies for addressing spatial trade-offs associated with the redistribution of marine resources. Moreover, this approach suggests key stakeholders or species that might be affected, allowing for options to be discussed proactively.</p>
