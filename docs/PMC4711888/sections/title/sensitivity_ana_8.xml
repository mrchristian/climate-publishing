 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results obtained by Jones and Cheung [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref042">42</a>] for two additional SDMs, Maxent [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref091">91</a>] and AquaMaps [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref092">92</a>], were used to analyse the sensitivity of relative catch potential and latitudinal range shifts obtained under RCP 8.5 to alternative SDM approaches and their underlying assumptions. In contrast with the DBEM’s discriminative approach that combines mechanistic and statistical tools, Maxent and AquaMaps use statistical methods to produce bioclimate envelopes that represent species’ relative habitat suitability. Species’ current distributions were determined by associating presence-only data with 30-year averaged environmental data (1971–2000). Results from AquaMaps and Maxent were available for 31 and 33 of the 98 species included in this study, respectively.
