 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Declines in relative abundance were projected by 2050 (relative to 2000) for the majority of sampled species (87 of 98 spp.) within British Columbia’s marine environment under both scenarios of climate change, with evidence of latitudinal and regional trends. In contrast, white sturgeon (
  <span class="italic">Acipenser transmontanus</span>) and Pacific sardines (
  <span class="italic">Sardinops sagax</span>) were projected to increase in abundance within BC’s marine environment under both scenarios, while manila clams (
  <span class="italic">Venerupis philippinarum</span>) were projected to increase in abundance by 14.5% under RCP 8.5, The remaining species (8 spp.) showed little change, with obtained projections oscillating around the baseline (-8.3 to +4.6%)(

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A poleward range shift in mean abundance by 2050 was projected for all species examined, with an estimated total median rate of 10.3 to 18.0 km decade
  <span class="sup">-1</span> under the lower and upper scenarios of climate change respectively (
  <a rid="pone.0145285.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0145285.g001">Fig 1</a>). A median rate of 10.1 to 17.8 km decade
  <span class="sup">-1</span> was projected for demersal species, while pelagic species were projected to move polewards at a median rate of 13.6 to 33.3 km decade
  <span class="sup">-1</span>. Rates tended to increase under the upper scenario of climate change relative to the lower scenario (68 of 98 spp.). Most of the remaining species (30 spp.) exhibited similar rates of poleward movement under both scenarios (i.e., within 7 km decade
  <span class="sup">-1</span> for 26 of 98 spp.), while only a few (4 spp.) exhibited slower rates of poleward movement (

   <p>Projections used an average 20-year latitudinal centroid centred on 2050 relative to that centred on 2000 under the lower (blue; RCP 2.6) and upper (red; RCP 8.5) scenarios of climate change. Where applicable, black dots represent the results for each species that were used to determine the aggregated median values.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While most species were projected to decline in relative abundance and to shift polewards relative to BC’s marine environment by 2050, species richness along coastal BC was projected to change little under either scenario of climate change. The absolute number of species that occurred within each cell (i.e., with a habitat suitability of greater than zero) reflected gains or losses of up to 3 species per cell. Similar latitudinal patterns to those observed for relative abundance and distribution were again evident, with greater losses in species richness likely to occur towards the southern coast of British Columbia, falling primarily between 48°N and 51°N. Notably, changes in species richness were projected off the coasts of Alaska and California, which mark the northern and southern latitudinal extents of many of the species’ distributions included in this analysis.</p>
