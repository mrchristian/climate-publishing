   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important concern highlighted by this study is the unequal distribution of relative losses in catch potential associated with regional ecological differences and poleward range shifts. In addition to coastwide declines in catch potential that are suggested when viewing cumulative effects on taxonomic groups (e.g., salmon and clams), species-based estimates reveal a stronger differential that correlates with latitude (i.e., impacts are less severe moving polewards).</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While there is increasing support for establishing equitable resource sharing agreements between Nations [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref095">95</a>] that might offer opportunities to offset such declines, the means by which such agreements could be achieved are uncertain [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref096">96</a>]. Although appearing feasible in theory, three key issues arise from the prospect of applying these agreements to offset regional impacts: the scale of resource-sharing agreements, the extended time frame, and the requirement of reciprocity.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Firstly, resource sharing agreements have both existed and been discussed primarily in a localized context, such as a single river system [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref096">96</a>], rather than at the regional level. For example, reciprocal agreements between First Nations historically allowed for shared use of a harvesting or processing site in exchange for another [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref097" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref097">97</a>]. Although such resources sharing agreements could aid in increasing First Nations’ participation in commercial harvests for manila clams and geoducks along the North and Central Coasts, where their abundances are projected to sufficiently increase under climate change so as to offset other regional losses, the cost of travelling to these regions may offset the prospective benefits. Similarly, FSC harvests hinge upon the feasibility of accessing resources locally, making trans-regional trips unlikely to prove viable or desirable.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The remaining two issues of time frame and reciprocity are intertwined, and relate to the circumstances that facilitated resource exchanges. Many of the key traditional institutions that generated considerable adaptive capacity for First Nations primarily supported responses to seasonal or inter-annual fluctuations in resource abundance and availability through reciprocity [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref044">44</a>], or operated as measures to prevent such long-term declines through spatial management [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref098" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref098">98</a>], selective fishing [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref099" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref099">99</a>], and forms of mariculture [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref100" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref100">100</a>], among other strategies. Since reciprocal agreements were intended to provide insurance against future resource scarcity, they inherently pivoted on the exchange of resources or access rights. Given that the scenarios presented in this analysis suggest that all species are likely to exhibit a relative decline in abundance in the southern regions of British Columbia, few arrangements remain where species could be traded or access rights exchanged in accordance with this principle. An exception may occur for commercial fisheries, given the potential increased abundance of warmer-water species (e.g., sardines) that is projected to occur within BC’s waters under climate change.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Externalized impacts</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In almost all circumstances, scenarios represented in this analysis illustrate outcomes where impacts are externalized, rather than internally resolved. For instance, redistributing access rights to fishing would serve to reallocate, rather than reduce, impacts. Given existing competition and conflict over key resources such as salmon and herring, it is unlikely that further reductions in catch potential associated with climate change will yield equitable outcomes.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Traditional clam beds serve as an ideal example of a method that could be applied to offset climatic impacts through internalized mechanisms, using local cultivation to generate increased productivity by enhancing native habitat rather than redirecting extraction efforts towards other regions or species. Clam gardens constructed in a manner akin to those situated near ancient settlements of the Northern Coast Salish and Laich-kwil-tach First Nations have been found to generate higher clam densities, biomass, and growth rates than non-walled beaches [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref100" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref100">100</a>]. These benefits were observed for Pacific littleneck clams (
    <span class="italic">Protothaca staminea</span>) and butter clams (
    <span class="italic">Saxidomus giganteus</span>), two clams that are of cultural, economic, and ecological importance to the region [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref100" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref100">100</a>]. Reinstating clam beds in First Nations’ territorial lands has been suggested as a means of simultaneously achieving local conservation and cultural objectives [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref101" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref101">101</a>], and may thereby provide a politically and ecologically viable option for mitigating climate-related impacts.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Joint management frameworks</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Management of salmon and herring stocks has been highly contentious due to the myriad of stakeholders who depend upon them, which include First Nations, recreational fisheries, and commercial fisheries. Therein, each group represents an additional layer of complexity: for example, the Fraser River system is home to nearly 100 First Nation communities, each of which depends upon their legal right to salmon harvests [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref096">96</a>]. Aside from fulfilling societal needs, salmon serve as key ecological components of the Pacific Northwest Coast, functioning as the mechanisms by which nutrients are transferred from the ocean to freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref102" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref102">102</a>,
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref103" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref103">103</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the projections above suggest the inability to fully offset declines in salmon and herring through a redistribution of fishing effort achieved under resource access agreements exchanged by First Nations, attaining a state of collaboration between First Nations, DFO, and other sectors has the potential to yield beneficial ecological and political results, if implemented correctly [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref096">96</a>]. Parallels exist between First Nations’ traditional fisheries management approaches and “modern” approaches (e.g., spatial management, mariculture, selective fishing, fishing closures), with differences arising primarily due to diverging worldviews (see 
    <a rid="pone.0145285.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0145285.s010">S7 Table</a>). By aligning analogous approaches, local application of traditional management strategies could provide opportunities to collaboratively engage in adaptive ecosystem-based management [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref104" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref104">104</a>] and to coordinate efforts to attain conservation objectives [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref101" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref101">101</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Established examples of joint-management initiatives may serve to provide frameworks for furthering conservation objectives and implementing traditional management practices. For instance, Garner and Parfitt (2006) identified three key case studies of joint-management of salmon fisheries on the Pacific Northwest Coast that endeavour to integrate First Nations and TEK into fisheries management decisions [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref096">96</a>]. For instance, the Nisga’a Nation have ensured their equal partnership in management by employing traditional fish wheel technology to monitor and assess stocks and by leveraging traditional ecosystem-based management practices that could be applied to plan long-term objectives and management approaches [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref105" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref105">105</a>]. Through such joint-management regimes, traditional fisheries management strategies could be applied to advance localized research directives and to reduce impacts on stocks under unprecedented environmental change. Moreover, the risk of conflict over declining resources underlines the need to establish common and equitable ground to ensure successful joint management of fisheries, and to leverage collective expertise.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results obtained through this analysis are representative of species’ responses to changes in environmental suitability under climate change that have been predicted or observed in the scientific literature [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref004">4</a>,
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref007">7</a>,
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref042">42</a>], and are likely conservative given the potential for cumulative impacts that are not included in the present analysis (e.g., acidification, overfishing, habitat loss, etc.)[
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref070">70</a>]. The DBEM was selected for the purpose of this study due to the model’s capacity to predict large-scale scenarios of ecological change for numerous species given limited biological and ecological data. This global model integrates population and dispersal dynamics, which aid in determining the biogeography of marine systems under scenarios of climate change [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref106" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref106">106</a>]. Although this version of the DBEM does not explicitly incorporate additional factors such as the influence of trophic interactions, evolutionary change, or fishing pressure, the use of empirically obtained habitat preferences based on species’ current distributions indirectly accounts for a ‘realized’ niche that is constrained by trophic interactions [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref107" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref107">107</a>]. While the resulting shift in species’ distributions from inclusion of trophic interactions differed only modestly [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref107" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref107">107</a>], these interactions may play a larger role in coastal regions and at localized scales, potentially leading to greater variation in projected responses to changing environmental conditions.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SDMs are inherently contingent on our understanding of species’ environmental preferences and capacity to respond to environmental change. For this reason, model certainty is much higher for species of commercial importance, where extensive research has been conducted on life history traits, environmental tolerance limits, and the extent of distributions. A species’ capacity to adapt is sensitive to the time scale over which a change occurs, as well as the magnitude of the change in environmental conditions, both of which can be further exacerbated when faced with multiple stressors. Inclusion of cumulative pressures (e.g., changes in fishing pressure, ocean acidification, habitat loss, changes in predation, etc.) would likely increase the rate and scale of estimated declines, with variation between species. For instance, Lam 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2014) used the DBEM to project the impacts of changes in SST, oxygen content (represented by O
    <sub>2</sub> concentration), pH (represented by H
    <span class="sup">+</span> concentration), and other variables such as salinity and ocean currents on the growth and distribution of marine species in the Arctic, and corresponding impacts on commercial fisheries by 2050 [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref108" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref108">108</a>]. The inclusion of ocean acidification in these climate change projections reduced landings by 11% relative to the ‘climate change only’ scenario, with a corresponding 15% reduction in revenue in the Arctic by 2050 [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref108" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref108">108</a>]. These projections have particular relevance for the species included in the present study, many of which are vulnerable to ocean acidification (e.g., Pacific halibut, sole, and invertebrates)[
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref108" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref108">108</a>], and suggest that impacts to food and economic security are likely to be more severe than those projected in this study. Ocean acidification has also been implicated in changes in competitive interactions between species, leading to ecosystem phase shifts [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref109" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref109">109</a>]. Moreover, as this study does not account for all stages within the life cycles of diadromous species such as salmon, sturgeon, and eulachon, anthropogenic or environmental impacts on freshwater systems may also alter the projected results of this study for these species.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study assumes that species’ current distributions are in equilibrium with environmental conditions [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref110" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref110">110</a>,
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref111" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref111">111</a>], and thereby accurately reflect preferred habitat and environmental tolerance limits. However, given anthropogenic disturbances, it has been argued that ranges used in SDMs do not fully capture species’ historical ranges, which could lead to biases in estimates of species’ current environmental tolerance limits [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref084">84</a>]. Within BC’s marine environment, such biases are likely less prominent as the majority of species included in this analysis have maintained their approximate historical range or occupy other areas with similar habitat, despite variations in abundance. Exceptions to this include invasive species, such as manila and varnish clams, and individual stocks of salmon and eulachon that have been extirpated.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, the use of inputs from different GCMs can yield a key source of uncertainty for DBEMs due to the direct relationship between the initial climate simulation and the estimates derived [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref112" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref112">112</a>]. To incorporate this uncertainty, multi-model ensembles have been shown to improve projections by accounting for model-selection uncertainty and providing an ensemble of data that tends to agree better with observations [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref113" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref113">113</a>]. Since this analysis evaluates scenarios generated from one coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate model (GFDL’s ESM2M), the inclusion of additional SDM-GCM combinations would help to further elucidate areas of uncertainty in model outputs, and to explore inter-model variation [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref036">36</a>]. The resolution of current GCMs is most suited to large-scale analyses due to the intricacies of representing fine-scale ocean dynamics. In particular, there has been a concerted effort towards resolving coastal mixing processes and mesoscale eddies within GCMs [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref114" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref114">114</a>]. While analyses at the scale of the EEZ can provide greater certainty with respect to regional impacts on fisheries, our understanding of impacts on coastal communities is therefore less certain due to both the complicated dynamics of coastal systems and the finer scale of the analysis.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species’ phenological and genetic responses to environmental change</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite globally consistent examples of poleward range shifts exhibited by species in response to climate change [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref002">2</a>,
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref004">4</a>], recent studies have argued that focusing predominantly on unidirectional shifts may, in fact, underestimate the true impacts of climate change on species’ distributions due to the complexity of potential configurations of the variables that instigate the shifts [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref115" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref115">115</a>]. As climatic niches are not necessarily associated with a latitudinally-defined gradient, habitat situated nearby, or closer to the equator, may provide refuge for species seeking new climate niches. While likely having little effect on projections at the global scale, finer-scale analyses such as this must acknowledge this uncertainty surrounding projections [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref115" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref115">115</a>]. Likewise, while some pelagic species have exhibited much faster rates of poleward movement [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref116" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref116">116</a>], rates of range expansion are dependent on the contrast of local temperature gradients, with strong variations in ‘climate velocities,’ or the rates and directions that isotherms shift through space [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref117" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref117">117</a>,
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref118" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref118">118</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, another study used a multi-model ensemble, including the DBEM, to project poleward range shifts of 26 to 28 km decade
    <span class="sup">-1</span> in the UK’s waters [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref084">84</a>], which are greater than the global median projected rates of 15.5 to 25.6 km decade
    <span class="sup">-1</span> obtained using the same ensemble [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref042">42</a>]. Furthermore, although demersal species were able to expand their ranges to deeper water if environmental conditions became more suitable within the model, pelagic species’ locations within the water column were not analysed in this study, but have been shown or projected to occur in response to climate change [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref070">70</a>,
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref119" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref119">119</a>]. Since this study focused on species currently harvested by First Nations for economic and subsistence purposes, changes in the relative abundances and distributions of southern species that are likely to shift polewards into BC’s waters were not taken into account, and may offer new harvest opportunities for First Nations’ fisheries. However, the potential for these invasive species to replace the full range of ecosystem services and cultural significance derived from species traditionally harvested would require further scientific analysis and community-based research.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rate at which different species can genetically and phenotypically evolve to accommodate environmental change is also an important area of uncertainty that has been explored through various studies [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref083">83</a>,
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref120" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref120">120</a>,
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref121" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref121">121</a>]. To date, scope for genetic adaptation to meet the observed rate of environmental change has only been studied for a few species through laboratory experiments [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref122" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref122">122</a>]. If adaptation to climate change were possible for marine species, our projections may represent an over-estimation of declines in catch potential. However, given the observed widespread responses of species to ocean temperature changes through shifts in distribution and phenology, long-term adaptation of marine species to continued environmental change may be unlikely.
