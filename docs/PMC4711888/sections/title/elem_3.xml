  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref050">50</a>], First Nations residing along coastal BC vary with respect to culture, traditions and diet associated with their fishing practices, making it inappropriate to assess climate-related impacts on First Nations as if they were a single, homogenous entity [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref034">34</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref051">51</a>]. Therefore, First Nations were purposively selected from each of the seven coastal administrative regions defined by the BC First Nations Fisheries Council (FNFC), forming a sample of groups with diverse marine resources, geographical locations, territorial sizes, and treaty statuses. Ultimately, 16 of 78 First Nations identified near BC’s coastline were selected, 12 of which fall under three overarching councils negotiating in the BC treaty process: the Council of the Haida Nation, the Tsimshian Nations Treaty Society, and the Maa-nulth First Nations. For the purpose of this study, these 16 Nations are referred to collectively under their respective treaty councils, with estimated populations recorded as of December 2013

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The biogeographical characteristics of coastal BC are characterized by considerable terrestrial and marine-based diversity due to a temperate climate and coastal upwelling system that generates nutrient-rich waters [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref022">22</a>]. These conditions yield highly productive environments with complex marine food webs and diverse coastal landscapes, from rocky intertidal zones, shallow rocky reefs, kelp forests, sandy nearshore areas, and estuarine ecosystems [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref022">22</a>]. While these regions share similar species assemblages and are characterized by comparable environmental conditions (e.g., oceanic currents and wind-driven upwelling) [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref054">54</a>], the FNFC’s administrative regions intersect with five distinct ecological regions: the North Coast, comprising the Hecate Strait and Dixon Entrance; Haida Gwaii, which includes the waters surrounding the islands; the Central Coast, including Queen Charlotte Sound, Queen Charlotte Strait, and the southern tip of Hecate Strait; the Strait of Georgia; and the west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref055">55</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref059">59</a>]. First Nations are likely exposed to different climate-related impacts on fisheries due to the differing ecological and biogeographical characteristics of these regions and to differing traditional and commercial harvests.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First Nations’ domestic fishing areas (DFAs) were derived from the approximate Statement of Intent (SOI) boundaries registered with the BC Treaty Commission as of October 2004, which were converted to 0.5° latitudinal by 0.5° longitudinal grid-cells to correspond with downscaled global climate model grids (
