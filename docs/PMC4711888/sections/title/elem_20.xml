 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Projections for pelagic species, such as eulachon, Pacific sardines, Pacific herring, and albacore tuna, tended to exhibit the greatest inter-model variability for both latitudinal range shift and relative catch potential estimates (Tables A and B in 
  <a rid="pone.0145285.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0145285.s003">S2 Text</a>). In these instances, the DBEM suggested larger estimates than those produced by either of the other two models. For example, the DBEM estimated a 44.4% increase in the relative abundance of Pacific sardines versus the 4.8% and 6.3% increases projected by the other models, while the DBEM projected a decline of 37.1% for eulachon in contrast with the declines of 5.0% and 6.8% estimated by AquaMaps and Maxent, respectively. Given that many of these pelagic species are warmer-water species, theoretical and empirical evidence suggest a northward shift in abundance that would increase catch potential within BCâ€™s waters [

  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref012">12</a>]. However, due to highly migratory patterns, accurately determining distributional shifts for pelagic species at higher trophic levels can prove challenging [
