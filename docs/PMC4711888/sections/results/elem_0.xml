  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Declines in relative abundance were projected by 2050 (relative to 2000) for the majority of sampled species (87 of 98 spp.) within British Columbia’s marine environment under both scenarios of climate change, with evidence of latitudinal and regional trends. In contrast, white sturgeon (
   <span class="italic">Acipenser transmontanus</span>) and Pacific sardines (
   <span class="italic">Sardinops sagax</span>) were projected to increase in abundance within BC’s marine environment under both scenarios, while manila clams (
   <span class="italic">Venerupis philippinarum</span>) were projected to increase in abundance by 14.5% under RCP 8.5, The remaining species (8 spp.) showed little change, with obtained projections oscillating around the baseline (-8.3 to +4.6%)(

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While most species were projected to decline in relative abundance and to shift polewards relative to BC’s marine environment by 2050, species richness along coastal BC was projected to change little under either scenario of climate change. The absolute number of species that occurred within each cell (i.e., with a habitat suitability of greater than zero) reflected gains or losses of up to 3 species per cell. Similar latitudinal patterns to those observed for relative abundance and distribution were again evident, with greater losses in species richness likely to occur towards the southern coast of British Columbia, falling primarily between 48°N and 51°N. Notably, changes in species richness were projected off the coasts of Alaska and California, which mark the northern and southern latitudinal extents of many of the species’ distributions included in this analysis.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With two exceptions, modest to severe declines in catch potential were suggested for all commercial fisheries with known First Nation participation (15 out of 17 spp.) under both scenarios of carbon emissions (

    <a rid="pone.0145285.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0145285.s005">S2 Table</a>). Estimates placed the Pacific herring commercial fisheries, comprising roe herring, spawn-on-kelp, and food and bait fisheries, as likely to experience the greatest relative impact under both climate change scenarios, with declines in catch potential ranging between 28.1 and 49.2% across coastal BC. Collectively, salmon (
    <span class="italic">Oncorhynchus</span> spp.) were projected to exhibit cumulative declines in catch potential of 17.1% to 29.2% within BC’s marine environment.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, an increase in the relative abundance of warmer-water species was projected to lead to new or increased opportunities for commercial harvests by 2050. For instance, catch potential for the commercial Pacific sardine (
    <span class="italic">Sardinops sagax</span>) fishery is likely to expand in abundance, with estimates ranging from 42.0 to 44.4% relative to the current baseline within BC’s marine environment. At a more localized scale, estimates indicated that the Heiltsuk intertidal clam fishery for manila clams (
    <span class="italic">Venerupis philippinarum</span>) and Pacific littleneck clams (
    <span class="italic">Protothaca staminea</span>) may experience slight gains in catch potential under the upper climate change scenario (+8.6%), or experience relative neutrality under the lower scenario (-0.5%).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conservative estimates of lower- and upper-thresholds of regional losses in annual landed revenue to a selection of First Nations’ commercial fisheries ranged between 6,720,000 and 11,820,000 CAD, translating to a 16.4% to 28.9% reduction in total landed revenue by 2050 based on 2001–2010 median values (
    <a rid="pone.0145285.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0145285.t003">Table 3</a>). Collectively, the commercial herring and salmon fisheries contributed approximately 74% of First Nations’ landed revenue in 2003 [
    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref090">90</a>], and are expected to comprise the majority of the decline in revenue under climate change (i.e., between 89.3% and 90.2%). These estimates do not account for impacts on auxiliary industries, such as fish processing and marketing, nor do they account for potential opportunities attained through an increased abundance of lower-latitude species. In particular, commercial sardine fisheries, for which First Nations held 50 per cent (

    <a rid="pone.0145285.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref093">93</a>], were projected to see increases within BC’s waters under both climate change scenarios.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While relative catch potential increased with latitude, all First Nations’ DFAs included in this analysis were projected to experience cumulative decreases in species abundance and corresponding catch potential, with less severe declines at higher latitudes. DBEM estimates suggested that the southern territories (Tsawwassen, Tla’amin, and Maa-nulth First Nations) will likely be exposed to a reduction in catch potential (between -15.2% and -27.8%) coinciding with both the upper and lower ranges of climate change. In contrast, the northern DFAs (Haida and Tsimshian First Nations) and those situated along the central or north-eastern coasts of Vancouver Island (Heiltsuk and ‘Namgis First Nations, respectively) were projected to experience lower relative reductions in relative catch potential for each territory, with estimates falling between -3.2 and -8.2%.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few trends emerged when comparing changes across latitudes (
    <a rid="pone.0145285.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0145285.g005">Fig 5</a>). For instance, projections for DFAs situated along the North and Central Coasts of British Columbia (Gitga’at and Haida, and Heiltsuk and ‘Namgis, respectively) indicated neutral or positive shifts in catch potential for white sturgeon (
    <span class="italic">Acipenser transmontanus</span>), kelp greenling (
    <span class="italic">Hexagrammos decagrammus</span>), and two species of perch (
    <span class="italic">Rhacochilus vacca</span> and 
    <span class="italic">Brachyistius frenatus</span>) under both scenarios. While varying regionally, both scenarios also suggested either a slight cumulative decline or negligible change in catch potential for clams, rockfish, lingcod, and sculpins across the North and Central Coast DFAs.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, territories situated along the west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) and the Strait of Georgia tended towards more severe declines across taxonomic groups and species in comparison with those projected for the North and Central Coast regions. The exceptions to this included scallops and eulachon (
    <span class="italic">Thaleichthys pacificus</span>), which displayed more variable trends: for instance, catch potential for eulachon found in the Hecate Strait along the North Coast was projected to exhibit declines similar to those in the WCVI region.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Catch potential for Pacific herring (
    <span class="italic">Clupea pallasii</span>) was projected to decrease in all study areas under both climate change scenarios, with DBEM estimates ranging from -26.0 to -49.2%. The results from AquaMaps and Maxent corroborated this projected decline, but offered more conservative estimates (-2.2 to -17.0%). Similarly, declines in salmon, which are cultural keystone species for First Nations on the Pacific Northwest Coast [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Projections for pelagic species, such as eulachon, Pacific sardines, Pacific herring, and albacore tuna, tended to exhibit the greatest inter-model variability for both latitudinal range shift and relative catch potential estimates (Tables A and B in 
    <a rid="pone.0145285.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0145285.s003">S2 Text</a>). In these instances, the DBEM suggested larger estimates than those produced by either of the other two models. For example, the DBEM estimated a 44.4% increase in the relative abundance of Pacific sardines versus the 4.8% and 6.3% increases projected by the other models, while the DBEM projected a decline of 37.1% for eulachon in contrast with the declines of 5.0% and 6.8% estimated by AquaMaps and Maxent, respectively. Given that many of these pelagic species are warmer-water species, theoretical and empirical evidence suggest a northward shift in abundance that would increase catch potential within BC’s waters [
