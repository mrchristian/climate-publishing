 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three studies have been conducted that estimate health adaptation costs in Europe – two global multi-sectoral cost studies, by the World Bank
  <a rid="b18-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18-ehi-8-2014-043">18</a> and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
  <a rid="b23-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23-ehi-8-2014-043">23</a> – and one global cost study focusing on the health service response alone.
  <a rid="b19-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19-ehi-8-2014-043">19</a> The multi-sectoral cost studies estimate costs of adapting to health impacts of climate change as part of other sector activities such as agriculture and water resources, as well as the health sector. The UNFCCC study, whose estimates are based on the methodology of the another cost study,
  <a rid="b19-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19-ehi-8-2014-043">19</a> is not presented here, as the study does not provide a cost breakdown for the European Region.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the World Bank’s Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change study,
  <a rid="b18-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18-ehi-8-2014-043">18</a> the “health sector” costs include only the costs of treating and preventing diarrhea cases for Europe and central Asia from 2010 to 2050 at 2005 prices. The results are presented with future costs in present values using an annual discount rate of 5% and 0%. The underlying health models do not predict increase in malaria cases for this region. However, investments in several other sectors have important implications for health, such as the water sector and extreme events, and hence these are added to the health sector costs below to give “health-related” costs. Two alternative global circulation models are used to predict future disease cases: the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM)-3 model (termed the “wet” scenario) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)-3 model (termed the “dry” scenario). Infrastructure investment (estimated as the cost of health education, water supply, and sewers) is estimated to cost between US$300 (€250) (CSIRO) and US$800 (€670) (NCAR) million annually. The adaptation cost for agriculture and fisheries (estimated as the cost to prevent climate change-attributed cases of malnutrition) is estimated at between US$470 (€390) (CSIRO) and US$1,320 (€1,100) (NCAR) million annually. Water storage and flood protection cost between US$300 million (€250) (CSIRO) and US$2,600 (€2,170) (NCAR) million annually. Preparing for extreme events – involving education and training schemes for target populations – is estimated to cost between US$500 (€415) (CSIRO) and US$1,000 (€830) (NCAR) million annually. The overall health-related costs for Europe and central Asia are estimated at between US$1.57 billion (€1.3 billion) (CSIRO) and US$5.72 billion (€4.8 billion) (NCAR).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two other global studies of health adaptation costs are based on economic integrated assessment models. De Bruin used the Adapted Regional Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (AD-RICE) model and estimated that health would be a very small total of adaptation costs for Europe up to 2050.
  <a rid="b24-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24-ehi-8-2014-043">24</a> Agrawala et al used the WITCH model (A World Induced Technical Change Hybrid Model) and estimated that there will be net cost savings in disease treatment of €0.74 billion with a doubling of CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations for western and eastern Europe combined.
  <a rid="b20-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20-ehi-8-2014-043">20</a> Watkiss and Taylor conclude that the estimates from both studies can only be considered illustrative because of the highly theoretical nature of these models, and their treatment of adaptation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of water-borne diseases, as many as 17.5 million additional diarrhea cases have been estimated as attributed to climate change by Ebi for the year 2030 for the WHO European Region.
  <a rid="b19-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19-ehi-8-2014-043">19</a> Based on emission reductions resulting in stabilization at 750 ppm carbon dioxide equivalent by 2210, and applying the unit costs of providing preventive services (immunization, and water and sanitation improvements) to avert these cases, the costs are estimated at US$217 million per year.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heat-health action plans have been strengthened in recent years. In France, the cost of preparing the heat-wave and health alert system (Système d’alerte canicule et santé [SACS]) in 2005 was calculated at €287,000 and the operating cost between June 1 and August 31 was calculated at €454,000, summing to a first year cost of €741,000.
  <a rid="b22-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22-ehi-8-2014-043">22</a> These costs cover mainly the additional human resource costs. Compared to the estimated health costs of more than €500 million, including loss of human life at the value of €37,500 per year of lost life, this intervention cost is relatively small.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For newly emerging infectious diseases in Europe, vaccination campaigns will be feasible where an efficacious vaccine exists. However, few actual vaccines are available on the market for vector-borne diseases. No available studies have estimated the costs of vaccinating the at-risk or high-risk populations in Europe.</p>
