 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The presentation of the available economic evidence-base on health costs and health intervention efficiency related to climate change in Europe shows major gaps in evidence, as well as limitations in the quality and usefulness of the existing studies.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, the few studies presented in this paper indicate that the economic evidence-base is incomplete and fragmented. There are few Europe-wide economic studies that provide a comprehensive overview of the economics of climate change health impacts and response measures. Likewise, there are even fewer peer-reviewed country or city-level studies that provide an adequate economic evidence-base to inform policy decisions. Economic evidence from non-EU European countries is particularly weak.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the lack of standardization of economic outcome measures is a serious constraint to the use of evidence by decision makers. As the literature review reveals, a range of economic outcomes are used, such as cost per DALY averted, cost per QALY gained, cost per case averted, cost per death averted, net cost or net present value, and economic benefits per unit of money invested. Few studies present all of these outcomes together. The outcome presented depends primarily on the study aim. Indeed, the choice of different outcome measures is justified by the fact that different decision-making contexts require expression of efficiency in different units. Interventions requiring public health funds tend to favor the use of cost per QALY gained or cost per DALY averted. Interventions requiring private investment or cost recovery from households, such as food-borne disease prevention or water and sanitation services, tend to show net present value or benefit–cost ratio. However, the reviewed economic studies do not analyze the mix of financing sources that might be required to successfully implement the evaluated interventions. This is a particular gap given that the analysis of financing options provides a concrete link from academic studies to policy makers.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, widely varying climate models and economic methods and impacts were used in the studies reviewed, making it difficult to compare results between studies. There are a large number of climate models that vary in their specifications and precision. Economic models include various types of general equilibrium model (where linkages between impacts in different sectors are quantitatively assessed), sector-specific estimates (with no linkage assessed between sectors), and also a mixture of the two such as the WITCH model.

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Valuation approaches vary between studies. For example, premature mortality is valued in terms of both a saved life and a saved life year. Valuing a saved life year usually leads to lower economic values than saved lives, especially for the elderly population. Furthermore, some studies only measure morbidity costs (mainly health-care costs) or some measure only mortality costs, while others include both morbidity and mortality costs. In general, when they are both included, mortality costs outweigh morbidity costs by several times. Given that mortality valuations are based on value of statistical life, and not actual financial transactions to reduce health risks, the major share of overall welfare gain from health protection measures is of a non-financial nature. Cost comparisons between studies are further impeded by the fact that the baseline year is often different, the years covered by the study are different, and some studies estimate future impacts in current values using discounting, while others do not. Good practice is to present results under different scenarios to show sensitivity of results to different assumptions or study scope and to support comparison.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourth, the number of studies that assess the health effects of climate change is very few. While general relationships and trends are predicted with increasing confidence as models are refined and data quality improves (eg, on changes in temperature and precipitation), the health impact numbers are still not known. The only EU-wide health economic estimates are on selected temperature-related disease burdens – on 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> and diarrheal disease cases. Given the variation in climate models and impact assessment frameworks used, combined with uncertainty in economic values, the resulting economic outcomes would have very wide confidence intervals or ranges if sensitivity analysis was conducted using alternative data inputs. However, this is rarely done in studies. This makes it extremely difficult to understand the range of likely economic impact or intervention efficiency, and thus reduces the strength of policy recommendation possible. Further, current available health vulnerability assessments have not been used to assess the economic costs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fifth, the long-time horizons involved in climate change make it important to clarify what is the baseline scenario. For example, should the costs of future measures take into account future expected health sector developments that affect underlying disease vulnerability and hence adaptation responses? This point is particularly relevant for the lower income countries of Europe where there is a greater adaptation deficit. Whether future health investments are labeled as development investments or adaptation investments will affect the calculation of adaptation costs. Given that investments in climate change adaptation will increasingly become part and parcel of a country’s development process, especially for lower income countries, the “development baseline” approach adopted by the World Bank study, for example, will underestimate the actual costs of adapting to climate change.
