 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The geographical focus of this review is on the 53 countries in the WHO European Region.
  <a rid="b10-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10-ehi-8-2014-043">10</a> Literature in the English language was obtained using a Medline search for the years 1990–2012 and an Internet search, and were included when they both (1) addressed health impacts of extreme weather events or effects of climate change on respiratory diseases and infectious diseases (vector borne, water related, and food borne) and (2) provided monetary estimation of the health impacts of climate change or the adaptation measures to protect health from climate change in Europe, or both. All costs are presented in euro (€) in the year of the study; when costs are presented in another currency, they are also converted to euro at the average exchange rate in the year of the study.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the title and abstract reviewed for relevance, full articles were obtained. Once a study was found to present quantitative estimates of health impact cost, health adaptation cost, or cost-effectiveness of interventions, the key results and methodological approaches were evaluated for inclusion or exclusion.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Manuscripts were grouped into three categories, depending on which economic measures were presented. These three types of studies have different primary purposes and are classified as follows:</p>
 <div list-type="order" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Health impact cost studies (also referred to as “damage cost” studies) estimate the societal costs (or benefits) (eg, the costs of disease treatment, the costs of lost production because of disease, value of premature mortality) of the health impacts of climate change, valuing health impacts in monetary units. The principle objective is to provide aggregated economic impact numbers, which allow assessment of importance over time (such as comparing to gross domestic product (GDP)) as well as provide a comparison of economic impacts in money metric across sectors, based on which policy makers can prioritize sectors where adaptive measures are most needed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Health adaptation cost studies estimate the costs of alternative measures to reduce, or avert altogether, the health impacts of climate change. The objective of health adaptation cost studies is to identify the expenditure required for specific health actions and thus enable realistic budgeting of fund-holding decision makers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Health economic evaluation studies compare the costs and benefits of health adaptation measures, estimating a return on spending in the form of a cost-effectiveness ratio (such as cost per death averted) or a cost–benefit ratio (monetary return per currency unit spent). The objective is to enable selection of efficient measures to protect the population’s health, in comparison with other health protection options or uses of public resources.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These three types of studies are related, and often draw on similar health and economic data. These outputs feed into other decision-making tools, such as multi-criteria analysis or policy analysis.</p>
