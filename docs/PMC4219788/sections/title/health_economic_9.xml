 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Health economic studies not only assess adaptation costs (above) but also compare these costs to health impacts and other outcomes in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) or cost–benefit analysis (CBA).
  <a rid="b25-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25-ehi-8-2014-043">25</a> Ideally, economic evaluation includes a comparative economic assessment of alternative policy options. The literature search revealed no studies that have specifically examined the costs and health effects of interventions specifically related to addressing the additional disease burden associated with climate change. However, several studies were found that assessed cost-effectiveness or cost–benefit of health interventions targeting climate-sensitive diseases. These are most available in the areas of preventing food-borne diseases, preventing diarrhea through rotavirus vaccination and preventing or treating air quality-related conditions. However, as these studies were non-specific to climate change, they fell outside the initial systematic search criteria. Therefore, the studies presented below illustrate the types of studies available, but they do not represent the entire published economic literature. These were included in this assessment as they provide indications for future research.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the area of heat-health early warning systems, while many European countries have heat-health plans,
  <a rid="b26-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26-ehi-8-2014-043">26</a> no studies were found from Europe that compare the costs and health impacts of such systems. A study from Philadelphia, United States of America, indicates the potential value for money of such systems. The Philadelphia heat-health early warning system, initiated in 1995, was considered unique at the time because of its coordination between different public and private agencies, including mass media campaigns and community mobilization. At a value of US$4 million (€5.4 million) per life saved, the gross benefits of the Philadelphia heat-health warning system were in the order of US$468 million (€626 million) over 4 years, or US$117 million (€157 million) per year. Additional non-valued benefit is from avoided morbidity. The annual marginal costs of the system were estimated at US$115,000 (€154,000), in addition to the costs of developing the system of US$60,000 (€80,000).
  <a rid="b27-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27-ehi-8-2014-043">27</a>,
  <a rid="b28-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28-ehi-8-2014-043">28</a> Hence, the cost per life saved is very low at less than US$4,000 (€5,350), indicating an efficient use of public funds. However, these costs are only marginal costs, and do not consider the redeployment of resources already paid for by public authorities, such as salaries and vehicles.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the area of food-borne disease prevention, quite a number of farm-level economic studies have been performed, focusing mainly on 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> prevention. These studies generally find that disease prevention is cost-effective or economically viable (ie, benefits greater than costs). For example:

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Economic studies on end-use food preparation studies are fewer. One study evaluated the potential cost-effectiveness of a disinfection program that targets high-risk food preparation activities in household kitchens in the United States of America, Canada, and United Kingdom.
  <a rid="b36-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36-ehi-8-2014-043">36</a> The average cost–utility ratio in United Kingdom was £86,341 (€124,770) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. A QALY is a positive measure of health, and is the equivalent of a year of life lived in full health. When targeting households with high-risk members (those less than 5 years of age, greater than 65 years of age, or immune compromised), the cost per QALY reduced to £28,158 (€40,700).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases result from air pollution, which are exacerbated with higher temperatures. While the pathways of effects are indirect and complex, the purpose of this presentation is to explore studies that assess the damage costs of overall air pollution and the economics of various response measures. The economic literature on air quality-related disease burden includes a range of studies examining different interventions applied at different levels, from sector-specific studies to national studies to Europe-wide studies.

  <a rid="b38-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38-ehi-8-2014-043">38</a> Most studies value economic gains by aggregating the value of reduced premature deaths, lower health-care costs, and work days gained because of lower morbidity. Few studies include other economic benefits, such as avoided damage to agriculture and ecosystems or avoided damage to infrastructure and public buildings from corrosive pollutants. Six studies identified including health impact measurement and presenting benefit–cost ratios were as follows:

  <a rid="b51-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51-ehi-8-2014-043">51</a> In France, a routine universal rotavirus immunization program was estimated to cost €138,000 per QALY saved and avoid annually 89,000 cases of diarrhea, 10,500 hospitalizations, and 8 deaths.

  <a rid="b54-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b54-ehi-8-2014-043">54</a> and costing US$9,500 (€6,940) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limited economic studies on vector-borne disease have been conducted in Europe. A hypothetical tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine for French troops stationed in the Balkans was estimated to avert 121 cases of TBE at a program cost of €10.05 million, thus costing €83,000 per case prevented.
  <a rid="b56-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56-ehi-8-2014-043">56</a> Based on estimated economic benefits of €4.37 million, the net costs were €5.68 million – and hence not justifiable on the grounds of providing economic returns. For Lyme disease, an economic study from the USA estimates the average cost per case averted to be US$4,466 (€4,190).
  <a rid="b57-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57-ehi-8-2014-043">57</a> However, cost-effectiveness is highly variable, depending on the vaccine price, incidence, and probability of early detection and referral. Hence, cross-border extrapolations should be made with care, adjusting for differences in key determinants.
