 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change will have large and diverse impacts on European countries. Some of these impacts are already being felt.
  <a rid="b1-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1-ehi-8-2014-043">1</a>â€“
  <a rid="b3-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3-ehi-8-2014-043">3</a> Health effects are among some of the major effects, for example, increased frequency and intensity of heat-waves and flooding, and more extended and changed distribution of disease vectors. In addition, health is indirectly impacted by many other factors that are themselves affected by climate change, such as water quality and quantity, ecosystems, food security, agriculture, transportation, energy production, and economic growth itself. Also in Europe, some health gains from climate change are anticipated, such as reduced winter cold-related deaths, and positive health and economic benefits of increased crop productivity in some geographical areas.

  <a rid="b4-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4-ehi-8-2014-043">4</a> However, in relation to climate change impacts, the 53 countries that make up the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region should not be analyzed as a homogeneous group of nations. These countries vary enormously in relation to geography, climate, sociocultural environment, health system development, population health status, and economic level. Hence, their vulnerability and capacity to respond to the health threats of climate change are widely divergent.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mitigation measures are currently not being implemented fast enough to prevent substantial changes to the global climate over the next 100 years.

  <a rid="b2-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2-ehi-8-2014-043">2</a> Hence, these new health threats will need adaptive responses to avert significant but as yet unpredictable health impacts with major implications for population welfare and economic indicators. In Europe, many actions are ongoing at country as well as at regional levels.
  <a rid="b6-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6-ehi-8-2014-043">6</a> Between 2004 and 2014, 22 of 53 WHO European Region countries (or 15 of 28 European Union countries) adopted national adaptation plan (NAP) or strategies.
  <a rid="b7-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7-ehi-8-2014-043">7</a> The majority of these include assessment of health as a vulnerable sector. The main health actions planned include strengthening health systems, early warning systems, disaster preparedness, awareness-raising of citizens, and specific legislative changes for buildings and constructions to regulate heat in the internal environment. The European Commitment to Act of the Fifth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health has further set direction on the action to take in the health sector and beyond to avert the adverse health effects of climate change.
  <a rid="b8-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8-ehi-8-2014-043">8</a> As a response, a total of 26 European countries have conducted national health vulnerability assessments between 2001 and 2012.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To respond effectively to the health effects of climate change, evidence is needed to justify action as well as support the selection, planning, and budgeting of preferred actions. Additional spending in the health sector will need to demonstrate value for money through health economic studies in order to access sustained funding flows to climate change adaptation activities. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review the economic evidence relating to the health impacts and adaptive responses to climate change in the WHO European Region, and to identify the most important evidence gaps to be filled and methodological issues to be addressed.</p>
