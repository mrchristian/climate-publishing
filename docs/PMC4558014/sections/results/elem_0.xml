 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study suggests that by 2080, under a high-emissions scenario (SRES A2), breeding and non-breeding ranges of North American birds are projected to change dramatically in size and location. These changes will produce distinct patterns of species gains and losses across the continent (
  <a rid="pone.0135350.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135350.g001">Fig 1</a>). During the breeding season, bird communities may gain as many as 80 species, centered on the far northern Canadian provinces, especially boreal forests, and central Alaska, and lose as many as 69 species (
  <a rid="pone.0135350.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135350.g001">Fig 1a and 1b</a>). Peak areas of loss include much of the area along the U.S.-Canadian border where Eastern deciduous forests, prairie potholes, as well as the high elevations of the Rockies and Sierra ranges occur. During the non-breeding season, bird communities may gain as many as 92 species, mainly in the border regions with Canada and Mexico, and may lose as many as 65 species (
  <a rid="pone.0135350.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135350.g001">Fig 1a and 1b</a>). Peak areas of loss in the non-breeding season are centered on central and southern California, the Gulf region, and southern coastal states (
  <a rid="pone.0135350.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135350.g001">Fig 1a</a>). Future mid- and low-emissions scenarios (SRES A1B and B2, respectively) show patterns of species gain and loss through time that are broadly similar, in both magnitude and location, to projections from the A2 scenario (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Combining projected range gains and losses suggests that future bird communities will differ markedly from current communities, particularly during the breeding season (
  <a rid="pone.0135350.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135350.g001">Fig 1c</a>). For the SRES A2, 2080 climate change scenario, mean dissimilarity between the present and future was 0.470 for the breeding season and 0.374 for the non-breeding season. In the breeding season, dissimilarity was greatest in the boreal forests and western United States. In the non-breeding season, dissimilarity was greatest around the Great Lakes and in northern Alaska.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Projections suggest that climate change will tend to push species toward higher elevations through the end of the century (SRES A2, 2080) (mean change in elevation across all species: breeding season: 22 m upslope; non-breeding: 29 m upslope). Many species are projected to move downslope, however (breeding season: 41% of taxa; non-breeding season: 36% of taxa). Variation in elevational responses across species underscores the importance of looking at individual species when estimating climate disruption. Over the same time interval and scenario, species distributions are expected to shift inland an average of 51 km during the non-breeding season and 4 km coastward during the breeding season (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The vast majority of variation in projected responses to climate change was due to individual species effects (~69â€“94%; 
  <a rid="pone.0135350.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135350.s005">S5 Appendix</a>). Speciesâ€™ habitat affinities based on the IUCN classification accounted for essentially none of the variation in current range stability or relative change in range size in either season (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All models that performed relatively well for the dataset (&lt;2 standard deviations from the mean) were included in the study. We conducted this evaluation based on AUC and deviance explained and further excluded models based on their disagreement with known species distributions evaluated by expert review. Test data were typically from the same locations as the training data, but they were sampled in different decades and modeled with different climates. To explore whether this biased performance metrics, we recalculated performance metrics using only the 558 and 580 (BBS and CBC) locations surveyed between 1980 and 1999 that were not surveyed in the 2000â€“2009 training dataset. This provided both a temporally and spatially independent test of model performance. Winter model performance improved with the spatially independent dataset. Performance of summer models improved according to AUC and deviance explained but declined according to True Positive Rate (TPR). Overall, our original model performance metrics were robust to the lack of spatial independence in the test dataset (
