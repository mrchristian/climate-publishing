 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assigned each species to a climate sensitivity status based on overall changes in climatic suitability: 
  <span class="italic">Climate endangered</span>, 
  <span class="italic">climate threatened</span>, or 
  <span class="italic">climate stable</span>. We defined 
  <span class="italic">climate endangered</span> as projected loss of more than 50% of current range by 2050 across all scenarios, with no net gain from potential range expansion. 
  <span class="italic">Climate threatened</span> was defined as projected loss of more than 50% of current range by 2080 across all scenarios, with net gain from potential range expansion possible. 
  <span class="italic">Climate stable</span> was defined as projected loss of less than 50% of current range across scenarios. 
  <span class="italic">Climate stable</span> included 46 species, defined as introduced (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 14) or native species with ranges that occur only marginally within our study area (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 32).
