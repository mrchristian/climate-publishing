 <div class="title">Projected Species Gains and Losses by BCR.</div>
 <p>Projected changes in the number of species occupying all the bird conservation regions (BCRs) in the US and Canada (except Hawaii). There are 36 sets of projections for each BCR (2 seasons × 2 responses (gains/losses) × 3 time periods (2020, 2050, 2080) × 3 climate change scenarios (A2, A1B, B2). Values represent the mean change (gain or loss) within each BCR.</p>
