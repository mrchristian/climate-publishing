 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Presence/absence data were obtained from two sources: the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref021">21</a>] and the Audubon Christmas Bird Count (CBC) [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref022">22</a>]. These surveys are remarkable in the breadth of spatial coverage and the use of consistent sampling methods. The BBS monitors bird populations in the United States and Canada between early May and mid-July. Survey routes are 39.4 km long with 50 stops. At each stop, participants conduct a 3-min point count and record birds seen or heard. We pooled observations of each species over the first 30 stops (~24 km) for each BBS route and distilled counts into presence/absence data. This allowed us to maintain a reasonable match to the resolution of the climate grids that we used for projections (10 x 10 km) and to balance the scales of BBS and CBC samples used in our models. The CBC began in 1900 to document early winter bird assemblages in North America and has a growing presence throughout the Western Hemisphere. CBC surveys are conducted within 24.1 km-diameter circles for one 24 h period during a two-week interval centered on December 25. For this study, all circles that fell within the boundaries of the United States and Canada were included. For every circle and count year, we distilled raw count data into presence/absence information for each species. Since all information was collected from existing datasets and no animals were handled, no specific permission was required for this project.
