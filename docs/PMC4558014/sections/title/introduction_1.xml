 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change presents a great challenge: balancing the conservation needs of species today while preparing for largely unknown responses in the future [

  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref007">7</a>]. Uncertainty around the biological responses of species to climate change makes informed management actions difficult; however, adaptive management frameworks can be developed once species-level assessments become available (e.g. [

  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref008">8</a>]). As one of the best-studied groups in the world, birds offer an opportunity to model climate change responses for a taxon as a whole, at large geographic scales, and with sufficient spatial resolution to be meaningful for on-the-ground conservation. Furthermore, since birds are so widespread and cover so many habitats, birds are a reasonable proxy for the overall implications of climate change for all wildlife in North America. Previous climate studies of North American birds have focused on responses dealing with few species or limited geographies [

  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref014">14</a>]. Overcoming these constraints requires large amounts of data, including both numerous species and broad spatiotemporal coverage.

Climate sensitivity can be included in future species vulnerability assessments to help prioritize conservation investments and to provide testable predictions for future monitoring of at-risk species [

Here we model the geographic ranges of 588 North American bird species across an array of future climate-emissions scenarios in both breeding and non-breeding seasons, and we use the results to assess the climate sensitivity of each species to inform conservation planning.
