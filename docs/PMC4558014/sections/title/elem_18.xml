 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study presents the first detailed analysis of the impacts of climate change on 588 species of birds in the breeding and non-breeding season across the continental United States and Canada. Grouping species’ range changes according to our climate sensitivity criteria results in over half (314 of 588) being classified as climate endangered or threatened in this century across multiple future climate projections, including even a moderate emissions scenario (SRES B2). Although these species will lose over half of their current climatically suitable ranges in this century, most are not on any conservation priority list. To persist through the end century, our results suggest these at-risk species will need additional monitoring beyond CBC and BBS to track disruption from climate change and management to prioritize and protect current and future ranges.</p>

   <span class="italic">Climate-endangered</span> species (21.4%) are projected to lose more than half of current climatic range by 2050 without the potential to make up losses with gains in new areas. The climate-endangered group clearly faces the highest risk of extinction or extirpation from climate change. Current management prescriptions often focus on site-level resilience or helping species track their shifting climate niche [
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref011">11</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref012">12</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref045">45</a>]. Neither action seems likely to help species with shrinking geographic ranges. For example, high elevation and high latitude species groups are often thought to face the problem of shrinking geographic ranges without expansion potential [
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref003">3</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref005">5</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref009">9</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref046">46</a>]. Conservation of these shrinking range species requires the identification of areas within their current range that will remain climatically suitable into the future. In addition, since many 
   <span class="italic">climate-endangered</span> birds are not currently on any conservation priority list, there is no formal monitoring or legal protection for these most at risk species. For example, Baird’s Sparrow (
   <span class="italic">Ammodramus bairdii</span>) is projected to lose more than 95% of current range, yet is listed as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Although listed as a priority species in some states (e.g., Wyoming; [
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref047">47</a>]), it is not in others (e.g. Colorado; [
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref048">48</a>]). We suggest that the 126 species in this category be considered by conservation entities for immediate monitoring beyond existing programs such as BBS and CBC.

   <span class="italic">Climate-threatened</span> species (32%) are projected to lose more than half of current climatic range by 2080, but show potential to make up losses in new areas. With climatic ranges shifting through geographic space, these species will depend on natural or assisted movement to new locations. Shifting ranges are a familiar concept for managers. Our assessment identifies which species are potential shifters (i.e., 
   <span class="italic">climate threatened</span>) and, when coupled with 10 × 10 km species-level maps (
   <a rid="pone.0135350.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135350.s001">S1</a> and 
   <a rid="pone.0135350.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135350.s007">S7</a> Appendices), where this shifting is most likely to occur. This directs conservation attention to places most suitable under future climate conditions. However, even if species are able to perfectly track their climatic niches, many may suffer due to shifts in other ecological realities (e.g., competition, predation) relating to changes in the overall community. Note that it is also possible for shifting species to benefit from new interactions (e.g., exploiting new food sources or novel interactions leading to a competitive advantage for nesting).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Climate stable</span> species (46.6%) are defined as species projected to maintain more than half of current climatic range across all scenarios and timeframes. Many stable species also have the potential for dramatic expansion (
   <a rid="pone.0135350.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135350.g002">Fig 2biii and 2c</a>) in addition to core range stability. This category is of lower conservation concern when thinking about climatic stability of geographic range. However, a climatically stable species could still be at risk from traditional conservation threats (e.g., habitat loss), and indirect effects of climate change that we were unable to model. For example, a rocky intertidal species could be climate stable but still experience significant threats from sea level rise, shifts in prey base, or competitors/predators shifting under climate disruption. In addition, our assessment may underestimate risks for Neotropical migrants because we were unable to model their responses to climate change on wintering grounds in Central and South America. Thus, a Neotropical migrant categorized as 
   <span class="italic">climate stable</span> based on the breeding season in North America may be more vulnerable than predicted if its range in the non-breeding season is strongly impacted. Future work needs to be done to better understand climate change impacts across the life cycle, and impacts on demographic processes not covered in this study [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate Sensitivity and Conservation Prioritizations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses show that current conservation prioritizations do not correspond closely with our estimates of climate sensitivity (
   <a rid="pone.0135350.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135350.g003">Fig 3b and 3c</a>). Instead current prioritizations seem to be evenly distributed across climate sensitivity categories (e.g., 60 of the 126 
   <span class="italic">climate-endangered</span> birds are not on any of the current prioritizations). A similar pattern has been observed elsewhere when climate sensitivity was assessed by expert opinion [
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref050">50</a>]. Thus, the causes of conservation threat today are seemingly independent of future climate sensitivity. However, any species that is already of conservation concern, and is climate endangered, is more at risk than a species of least conservation concern. Although decisions on how to balance projections of the future with present conservation status will vary depending on context, conservation assessments should incorporate information on future climate sensitivity into a formal decision-making framework centered on adaptive management. For 
   <span class="italic">climate-endangered</span> species already of concern, conservation efforts should focus on protecting areas that are already occupied and are expected to remain suitable under future scenarios. These climate strongholds are paramount for the long-term protection of the species. For 
   <span class="italic">climate-threatened</span> birds already of concern, this study suggests where these species will be able to move in the future, aiding planning efforts for assisted migration. 
   <span class="italic">Climate stable</span> species will need the least amount of management, but should still be monitored to ensure that indirect consequences of climate change do not result in rapid range contractions or population declines.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Idiosyncratic Responses to Climate Change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relatively small amount of variation in future range explained by climate change scenario, habitat affinity, and migratory strategy should not be misinterpreted as signaling that these factors are unimportant. The minor differences in response across climate change scenarios for most species probably reflects the broadly similar trajectories of SRES scenarios until late in the century [
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref032">32</a>]. These results underscore the idiosyncratic nature of projected bird responses to future climate change. Similarly, elevational shifts were very modest when averaged across species in both seasons, but showed considerable variation, consistent with the diversity of responses recently documented (e.g., [
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref046">46</a>]). Geographic responses to climate change varied widely among species and across seasons with greater northward shifts during the breeding season and greater shifts inland during the non-breeding season. Finally, species gains (
   <a rid="pone.0135350.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135350.g001">Fig 1b and 1c</a>) along the border with Mexico would very likely increase if more Neotropical species were included in the analysis.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inclusion of survey effort and survey timing data for CBC and BBS models, respectively, allowed us to generate effort-adjusted and time-adjusted predictions of occurrence analogous to those produced in other modeling efforts [
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref051">51</a>]. Occupancy modeling [
   <a rid="pone.0135350.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref052">52</a>] is an alternative approach sometimes used in species distribution models that might have allowed us to characterize occurrence probability as a function of bioclimatic variables while accounting for detection probability as a function of survey effort or timing. Neither CBC nor BBS survey data are well suited for occupancy modeling, however, particularly with respect to meeting assumptions about population closure across time and space. In addition, it remains unclear how well detection and occurrence functions can be distinguished with current methods and some authors suggest the risks associated with more complex occupancy models outweigh the benefits [
