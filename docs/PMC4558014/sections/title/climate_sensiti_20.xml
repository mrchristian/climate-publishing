 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses show that current conservation prioritizations do not correspond closely with our estimates of climate sensitivity (
  <a rid="pone.0135350.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135350.g003">Fig 3b and 3c</a>). Instead current prioritizations seem to be evenly distributed across climate sensitivity categories (e.g., 60 of the 126 
  <span class="italic">climate-endangered</span> birds are not on any of the current prioritizations). A similar pattern has been observed elsewhere when climate sensitivity was assessed by expert opinion [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref050">50</a>]. Thus, the causes of conservation threat today are seemingly independent of future climate sensitivity. However, any species that is already of conservation concern, and is climate endangered, is more at risk than a species of least conservation concern. Although decisions on how to balance projections of the future with present conservation status will vary depending on context, conservation assessments should incorporate information on future climate sensitivity into a formal decision-making framework centered on adaptive management. For 
  <span class="italic">climate-endangered</span> species already of concern, conservation efforts should focus on protecting areas that are already occupied and are expected to remain suitable under future scenarios. These climate strongholds are paramount for the long-term protection of the species. For 
  <span class="italic">climate-threatened</span> birds already of concern, this study suggests where these species will be able to move in the future, aiding planning efforts for assisted migration. 
  <span class="italic">Climate stable</span> species will need the least amount of management, but should still be monitored to ensure that indirect consequences of climate change do not result in rapid range contractions or population declines.
