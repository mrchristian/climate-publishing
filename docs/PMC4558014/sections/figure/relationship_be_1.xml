   <span class="bold">(a)</span> Two-dimensional density plot (10% contours) of North American bird species showing current range stability versus potential range expansion for 
   <span class="bold">(b)</span> breeding (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 475) with three distinct groups: (i) current geographic range decreases with little to no expansion potential; (ii) current geographic range shifts to other parts of North America; and, (iii) current geographic range remains stable and, in some cases, expands, and 
   <span class="bold">(c)</span> non-breeding seasons (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 503). Species with expansion values &gt;1.0 were truncated to 1.0 to appear on plots.
