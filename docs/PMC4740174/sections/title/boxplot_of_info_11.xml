 <p>Models are fitted on variation in the climate proxy against the number of extinct genera (estimated from model agreement outputs) from 120 to 35 kyr ago, as a function of temporal lag between climate variation and time of extinction. The first regression model assumes a linear relationship between climate variation and the number of extinct genera, whereas the second model assumes no such relationship (that is, no climate effects on megafauna extinction). An ER of &gt;&gt; 3 would indicate support for the slope (climate effect) model
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>; thus, the observed ratios of â‰¤1.2 provide no evidence of a climatic influence on extinction.
