 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate an accurate chronology for the extinct megafauna and earliest human arrival in Sahul, we developed an ensemble-hindcasting model framework. We applied a set of six frequentist statistical methods (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Methods</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 1</a>) to high-quality rated
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a> time series for 16 megafauna genera and to the archaeology of first human colonization of Sahul (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>); these represent all of the available data (for both the megafauna and the archaeology time series) suitable for analysis (see details on the quality-rating approach in Methods). We developed a multi-model comparison (see Methods) to estimate the temporal window of coexistence between humans and megafauna. Our results show a peak in extinction events at 42.1 kyr (that is, median value of the distribution of estimated extinction dates in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>) with a continent-wide confidence interval (CI
  <sub>megafauna</sub>) ranging from 36.7 to 48.1 kyr (75th and 25th percentiles of the distribution of estimated extinction dates in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>, respectively).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The earliest estimated extinctions for 
  <span class="italic">Congruus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Megalibgwilia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Metasthenurus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Palorchestes</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Sthenurus</span> were between 61 and 51 kyr, followed by 10 genera (all remaining genera, excluding 
  <span class="italic">Thylacinus</span>) estimated to have been driven extinct between 44 and 35 kyr. We provide similar statistical support for the first human arrival in Sahul at 55.6 kyr (CI
  <sub>human</sub>=55.4–55.7 kyr for the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively), which is similar to other recent estimates
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">11</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a> and indicates a median window of continent-wide coexistence of 13.5 kyr (CI=7.3–19 kyr, calculated as lower CI
  <sub>human</sub>−upper CI
  <sub>megafauna</sub> and upper CI
  <sub>human</sub>−lower CI
  <sub>megafauna</sub>) before the peak of megafauna extinction (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>). Interpreting the youngest dated fossil records for each taxon as the actual time of extinction (ignoring the Signor–Lipps effect) would predict an older extinction peak at 50.8 kyr (CI
  <sub>megafauna</sub>=45.9–57.1 kyr, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>), whereas the oldest dated archaeological evidence for human arrival would be 55.5 kyr (CI
  <sub>human</sub>=47.3–63.7 kyr; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore the potential role of variation in climate conditions on this extinction chronology, we (i) tested whether climate conditions during the estimated period of megafauna extinction are unique compared with previous climatic conditions over the preceding 60 kyr (i.e., from 120 to 60 kyr ago); and (ii) correlated the number of extinct taxa with climatic conditions from 120 kyr ago until the end of the extinction peak (about 35 kyr; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>). We expressed climate variation over the last 120 kyr using several proxies (see Methods), including reconstructed temperature anomalies from central East Antarctica
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>, modelled El Niño/Southern Oscillation variability ‘power' (ENSOp)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>, and anomalies and the velocity of changes in both hindcasted temperature and precipitation from Sahul (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). Other climate proxies have previously been used to investigate the effects of climate shifts on megafauna extinctions
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">13</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>, but these potentially describe local climatic conditions rather than continent-wide trends.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relatively arid conditions dominating marine isotope stage (MIS) 3 from 59 to 24 kyr
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>) are not unique. There were periods before MIS3 when climate was considerably more arid and yet these genera persisted. For example, mean annual temperatures in Antarctica were up to 4 °C warmer during the estimated period of megafauna extinctions than at the end of MIS4 (the interval from 72 to 59 kyr
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>), representing a shift of temperature anomaly in Antarctica (i.e., temperature differences from the present day) from a mean of −10 to −6 °C (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1d</a>). Temperatures in Sahul indicate a similar trend, although MIS3 warming was &lt;1 °C higher than MIS4 conditions (a shift from a mean anomaly of −2.5 °C at MIS4 to −1.5 °C at MIS3; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1e</a>) and precipitation anomaly decreased by &lt;1 mm per day during the MIS4/3 transition (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1f</a>). These temporal trends in climate are supported by higher ENSOp during MIS3 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1g</a>), which indicates more arid conditions. Climate velocity proxies indicate that genera would have had to shift their ranges by moving up to 10 and 150 m per year (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1h</a>), to track shifts in temperature and precipitation, respectively, during MIS3. During MIS5 (123–72 kyr)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>, however, mean temperatures in Antarctica were about 2 °C warmer (
  <span class="italic">T</span> °C
  <sub>MIS5</sub> anomaly=−3 °C versus 
  <span class="italic">T</span> °C
  <sub>MIS3</sub> anomaly=−5 °C; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1d</a>) and both temperatures and precipitation in Sahul appear to have been higher than during MIS3 (up to 0.4 mm per day of precipitation and &gt;1.5 °C warmer). Higher ENSOp at MIS5 (ENSOp
  <sub>MIS5</sub>=300 versus ENSOp
  <sub>MIS3</sub>=200; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1g</a>) indicates more extreme aridity between 100 and 80 kyr than during MIS3.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether climate could have affected the number of genera that went extinct in Sahul, we used an information-theoretic evidence-ratio approach (evidence ratio (ER) of Akaike's information criterion (AIC) model weights; 
  <span class="italic">ER</span>&gt;&gt;3 would indicate strong evidence of a climate effect; see Methods and ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>). We fitted two regression models to the number of extinct genera every 2 kyr (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>) against the value of each of the six climate proxies at the same date (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1d–h</a>). The first model assumes a linear relationship between climatic variation and the number of extinct genera, whereas the second assumes no relationship (intercept-only ‘null' model). The ER quantifies the extent of support for the linear model (that is, climate related to the number of extinct genera) relative to the ‘null' model (no climate effect)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>. We also accounted for possible temporal lags, as extinctions could be driven by earlier climatic variation
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">8</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a> (see Methods). We detected no evidence of a correlation between the timing of extinction events and variation in climate based on any of the measures of climate used here. ERs were ≤1.2 for all climate indices whatever the temporal lag (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>), based on either the estimated model-agreement extinction outputs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>) or the distribution of last fossil ages for each taxon (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>). This demonstrates no support for the climate-driven extinction hypothesis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lack of statistical support for a linear relationship between the number of extinct genera and any of the climate proxies (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>) indicates that the role of climate change was either negligible, secondary and/or synergistic with humans, or operated at spatial scales too restricted to be detected in the continent-wide megafauna data set. There are also physiological and ecological reasons to expect that any increase in aridity would have favoured large-bodied animals
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>. However, local environmental changes
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">13</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a> could have led to local extirpation of genera and habitat fragmentation, possibly exacerbating human predation on megafauna, as has been suggested for Eurasia
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a> and South America
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>. This continent-wide result is consistent with the fact that there are no unique extreme climate conditions during MIS3 that could plausibly lead to the inferred accumulation of extinction events during this period (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>). Indeed, even more extreme conditions occurred during MIS5, when all the genera we tested were extant.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, even under the fastest climate velocities in MIS3, megafauna taxa would have needed to migrate no more than 150 m per year (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1h</a>), to track favourable climatic conditions. At such a low spatial velocity of climate change, variation in vegetation composition (i.e., expansion of open shrublands, grasslands and woodland) as observed in pollen records
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a> and carbon isotope signatures
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">10</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a> would have occurred slowly; thus, herbivore genera would have easily been able to migrate in response to shifts in the distribution of food and water resources
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>. In addition, climate velocity estimates are sensitive to the spatial resolution of the analysis (that is, velocity increases at coarser spatial resolutions)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>; hence, we are likely to have overestimated the real velocities that the megafauna experienced 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span>, owing to the 1 × 1° resolution of our climate data set.
