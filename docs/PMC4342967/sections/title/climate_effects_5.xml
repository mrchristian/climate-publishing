 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not only can climate change affect habitat suitability and demography of ticks, it might also affect important hosts necessary for persistence of both ticks and tick-borne pathogens. Several of the models described in ยง3 &amp; 4 incorporate hosts implicitly by allowing climatic conditions to affect host-seeking activity and presumably host encounter rates (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C15">15</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C30">30</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C87" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C87">87</a>]); given that a tick is questing, contact rates with hosts are generally assumed to be constant. However, the relevant parameters concerning host-seeking activity by ticks and impacts of climate change on the distribution and abundance of tick-hosts have rarely been incorporated into projections of the future distributions of disease risk. Because the most important hosts for 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> ticks in areas impacted by Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases are endotherms, the effect of climate warming is expected to be buffered by physiological temperature regulation. Nevertheless, a recent study by Roy-Dufresne 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C99" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C99">99</a>] indicates that the geographical range of the white-footed mouse (
  <span class="italic">Peromyscus leucopus</span>) has extended northward in Quebec coincident with climate warming between 1975 and the present. Roy-Dufresne 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C99" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C99">99</a>] project that, because this mouse is so important both to tick survival [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C100" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C100">100</a>] and transmission of 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C101" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C101">101</a>], 
  <span class="italic">A. phagocytophilum</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C102" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C102">102</a>] and 
  <span class="italic">Babesia microti</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C103" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C103">103</a>], continued range expansion will facilitate poleward expansion of Lyme disease. Population genetic analyses of white-footed mice in Quebec suggests that, with the exception of large rivers, there are few geographical barriers to gene flow that might inhibit the ability of this species to track a warming climate and expand northward [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C104" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C104">104</a>]. While some models of tick range expansion in Canada indicate that long-distance dispersal on migratory birds will help ticks and 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> track suitable conditions for tick survival as the climate warms [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C105" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C105">105</a>], a recent projection of a 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> risk index suggests that the expansion of the Lyme disease agent will be limited by the dispersal of 
  <span class="italic">P. leucopus</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C106" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C106">106</a>]. The degree to which climate change will alter the spatial distributions, population dynamics and physiology (especially immunology) of hosts for ticks is a poorly studied but promising area for future research.
