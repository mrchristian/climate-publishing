 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anthropogenic climate change over the past century has led to mean global temperatures consistently above those historically recorded as well as to increased variability in temperature and precipitation [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C1">1</a>]. One of the most discussed, but perhaps least understood consequences of global climate change is its effect on infectious disease and human health [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C2">2</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C3">3</a>]. Although there is no shortage of predictions for how infectious disease will expand or shift in range, most are built upon the assumption that current climatic conditions are what limit the distribution of these diseases, e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C4">4</a>]. Whether or not this assumption holds, however, is rarely known [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C5">5</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C6">6</a>], in part because of difficulties demonstrating the cause(s) of absence [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C7">7</a>]. This is particularly true for tick-borne diseases where data on mechanistic relationships between climate and physiology of the tick vector and pathogen are often limited.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is frequently invoked as a primary cause of expansions in incidence of tick-borne diseases, particularly Lyme disease. In the nearly 40 years since Lyme disease was first described, both the number and geographical range of reported human cases have increased dramatically in North America [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C8">8</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C10">10</a>] and Eurasia [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C11">11</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C12">12</a>]. Other tick-borne diseases, including tick-borne encephalitis, human babesiosis and granulocytic anaplasmosis, have also emerged and expanded on these continents. Although these increases in incidence and range have been occurring simultaneously with warming trends, the effects of climate are difficult to disentangle from other potential causes. First, case reports typically increase with increasing awareness of emerging diseases on the part of healthcare providers and the public, but these trends might not reflect actual increases in infection or disease. Second, ticks and tick-borne diseases may be expanding for reasons that have nothing to do with climate, for instance, because of recolonization of regions that were previously unsuitable following large-scale land clearing, but with no clear impact of climate change [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C13">13</a>]. Thus, even when climate change, tick population dynamics and epidemiological patterns are correlated, causation is difficult to establish and specific causal factors hard to confirm.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An additional challenge in understanding the impacts of climate change is the sheer number of components in the biology of vectors, hosts and pathogens that are potentially influenced by climate, including survival rates and phenology of immature and mature ticks, fecundity, host encounter rates, vector competency, as well as replication rates of the pathogen and the community dynamics of hosts. The myriad climatic variables, influences and interactions have posed a significant challenge to researchers attempting to understand and predict the net effect of climatic conditions and climate change on tick-borne disease [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C14">14</a>]. Indeed, it is likely that climate change will have countervailing influences on different components of the disease system. Warmer conditions, for instance, often not only lead to faster rates of tick development [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C15">15</a>] but also to reduced host-seeking activity [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C16">16</a>] and stronger immune responses in some vector taxa [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C17">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite these challenges, the importance of understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change for the distributions and intensities of ticks and tick-borne infections is only increasing as the global climate continues to warm. This is particularly true for 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> ticks and the pathogens they transmit, which are the focus of this review. Two main approaches have been used to project how the distribution of 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> and the pathogens they transmit will change as the climate changes. The first approach consists of an effort to find the set of environmental factors that best explains the current distribution of ticks (or of tick-borne disease) and, assuming that those conditions represent suitable habitat, project future distributions using models that estimate where that set of conditions will occur in the future. This approach is largely 
  <span class="italic">phenomenological</span>, in that environmental factors are selected based on correlations between those factors and the presence (or less commonly, the abundance) of ticks or of tick-borne disease, but typically without knowledge of underlying mechanisms. The second attempts to determine the relationship between specific environmental factors and at least some tick-demographic transitions, and asks which geographical locations currently or in the future provide the environmental conditions that allow tick populations and their associated pathogens to persist or grow. This approach is largely 
  <span class="italic">mechanistic</span>, in that it focuses on the mechanisms by which abiotic factors affect tick-demographic parameters. Importantly, both approaches also assume that abiotic conditions are predominantly important, an assumption we return to in §2.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both approaches offer insight but have serious limitations [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C18">18</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C20">20</a>]. The phenomenological approach generally employs spatially or temporally broad and ecologically relevant datasets, but risks basing models on spurious rather than causal relationships when it does not first establish the mechanisms governing the effects of environmental variables on tick demography. In addition, the absence or rarity of ticks in certain regions is often assumed to be caused by unsuitable (current) conditions in that region, but such unsuitability is rarely if ever established [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C21">21</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C22">22</a>]. Lastly, the different spatial and temporal scales of these phenomenological studies, not to mention the different climatic variables they include, have made it difficult to identify and evaluate consistent patterns in associations [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C23">23</a>]. The mechanistic approach, on the other hand, typically uses controlled experiments to determine the effects of specific environmental conditions on a handful of specific developmental or demographic responses. Because the environmental conditions are usually imposed in laboratory settings, which necessarily exclude many dimensions of ecological realism (e.g. variability in conditions, interacting species), one must take care in extrapolating relationships observed in the laboratory to the field. Field experiments can provide more ecologically relevant data but are usually of limited scope focusing, for instance, on only a subset of relevant demographic processes, often in few locations, or physically restraining ticks in a way that complicates interpretation of survival patterns [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C24">24</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C28">28</a>]. The advantage of this approach is that projections are based on mechanistic relationships rather than statistical associations. But while the models used to integrate these empirical studies have become increasingly sophisticated [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C29">29</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C32">32</a>], they are still based on few empirical data and best guesses about key parameters.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent advances in modelling effects of climate change on both free-living and parasitic species offer promising avenues for assessing climate effects on tick-borne disease. For instance, hierarchical analyses of both the fundamental and realized niches of the key interacting species (e.g. parasite, vector, reservoir host, ‘accidental’ host), at multiple spatial scales can help bridge the gap between phenomenological and mechanistic approaches [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C33">33</a>]. Similarly, Liu 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C34">34</a>] provide an example of a species distribution model applied to a pathogen in which habitat structure, host diversity and propagule pressure are considered, while autocorrelation and sampling bias are statistically controlled. Also, the recent application of next-generation matrix models to tick-borne diseases has provided a robust means of identifying the most important demographic and epidemiological processes in the establishment of ticks and tick-borne disease.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we review the literature on: laboratory and field studies linking abiotic conditions to tick demography and behaviour (§2); phenomenological models of ticks and tick-borne diseases affected by climate (§3); mechanistic models of tick dynamics and distributions as affected by climate (§§4 &amp; 5); climate effects on important hosts and pathogens (e.g. via changing phenologies) (§§6 &amp; 7). Last, in §8, we will point out knowledge gaps and suggest new approaches.</p>
