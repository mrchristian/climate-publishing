 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Direct effects of climate on tick-borne pathogens have been neglected, but the potential exists for climatic conditions experienced by ticks to influence persistence and replication rates of pathogens before, during and after seasonal diapause. Recently, both theoretical and empirical studies have addressed how climatic conditions, specifically the severity of winter cold, affect genotype frequencies of 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> via influences on the phenology of larval and nymphal ticks [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C107" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C107">107</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C108" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C108">108</a>]. In North American Lyme-disease-endemic regions with relatively mild winters, including the northeastern United States, each year's cohort of larval ticks ecloses and begins seeking hosts in August, about two months after the prior generation's nymphal cohort has peaked in May or June. As a result of this time lag between host inoculation by nymphs and pathogen acquisition by larvae, larvae should acquire only those genotypes of 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> that are able to persist in hosts for several months [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C107" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C107">107</a>]. The 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> genotypes known to persist well in white-footed mice tend to be the ones that are particularly invasive in humans [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C109" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C109">109</a>â€“
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C111" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C111">111</a>]. In the Midwestern United States, where winter temperatures are lower and the climate is more extreme, 
  <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span> exhibits a 3-year life cycle with fairly synchronous nymphal and larval emergence, and the more persistent human-invasive genotypes thus tend to be under-represented [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C107" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C107">107</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C112" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C112">112</a>]. Consequently, it is plausible that a warming climate will facilitate dominance by human-invasive strains of 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> in the Midwest, with potentially strong epidemiological consequences [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C107" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C107">107</a>]. Similarly, if we assume that larval development and emergence will be accelerated relative to nymphs in a warming Northeast (e.g. if nymphal emergence is primary controlled by photoperiod [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C113" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C113">113</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C114" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C114">114</a>]), then we would expect less persistent 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> strains to become more common. An analysis of tick phenology in a warming climate by Levi 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C115" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C115">115</a>], however, indicates that activity peaks of both larval and nymphal 
  <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span> s have advanced equally over the past 20 years, in which case the persistent strains should remain dominant.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transmission by 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">I. persulcatus</span> ticks of TBEV to wildlife hosts typically results in short-term infection that might not be disseminated beyond the site of the tick bite. As a consequence, the transmission cycle of TBEV appears to rely largely on simultaneous feeding (co-feeding) by infected nymphs and uninfected larvae in close proximity on the host's body [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C116" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C116">116</a>]. For TBEV to be maintained in an enzootic cycle that can result in zoonotic transmission, it is often assumed that some degree of synchrony in the seasonal questing activity of larval and nymphal ticks is therefore necessary [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C117" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C117">117</a>], a view supported by the large contribution of co-feeding transmission to 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> in an NGM model [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C91" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C91">91</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C92" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C92">92</a>]. An NGM model of Powassan virus, a close relative of TBEV, that explicitly included the overlap between larval and nymphal feeding, suggests that climatic factors that reduce their synchrony will reduce enzootic transmission, although modest vertical transmission might still maintain the virus populations [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C93" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C93">93</a>]. Kurtenbach 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C108" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C108">108</a>] suggested that, like other pathogens that cause only short-lived infections in reservoir hosts, TBEV maintenance might be facilitated by milder climates that permit extended host-seeking activity of both larvae and nymphs, which should result in seasonal overlap and co-feeding. It stands to reason that climate changes that reduce temporal overlap between larval and nymphal feeding would reduce the risk of TBE. Long-term studies will be necessary to evaluate this expectation.
