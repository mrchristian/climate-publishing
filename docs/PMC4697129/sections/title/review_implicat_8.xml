 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strengthening health systems is the first area of focus for most national health adaptation plans to reduce the current burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Components of strengthening health systems include the essential public health services. Of particular importance are the following elements

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Building the resilience of current and planned health programs includes strengthening coordination across departments in ministries of health mandated to manage climate-sensitive health outcomes (including vector-borne diseases, diarrheal diseases, food and water safety, noncommunicable diseases, and nutrition), and across ministries and departments whose policies and programs can affect these health outcomes. Coordination with sectors such as agriculture, water, and disaster risk management will facilitate identifying potential synergies and promote health co-benefits (see the example of Indonesia in a later section). For example, choices made on enhancing crop yields through irrigation or microdams could not only reduce food insecurity but could also provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes, snails, and other disease vectors.</p>
