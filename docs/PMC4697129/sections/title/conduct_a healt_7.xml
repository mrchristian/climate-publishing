 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and others have published guidance on conducting a health vulnerability and adaptation assessment.

  <a rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib10">10</a> Many countries have conducted some form of a vulnerability and adaptation assessment, although few are comprehensive. An example of a comprehensive assessment is one conducted for Kiribati, a low-lying, resource-poor Pacific atoll nation.

  </a> The process assessed risks to health and sources of vulnerability. The high-priority adaptation needs identified included policies and programs to improve management of water safety and water-borne disease; food safety and food-borne diseases; and vector-borne diseases. Improving disease surveillance was also critical to managing most climate-related health risks in Kiribati.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assessment of the risks of climate change is an iterative process rather than a one-off activity.
  <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">12</a>, 
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">13</a> Vulnerabilities are likely to shift as climate and development proceed, technologies advance, and new evidence and knowledge emerges on trends, projections, and best practices in adaptation. Therefore, conducting regular vulnerability and adaptation assessments that can then be incorporated into national adaptation plans is a recommendation in the H-NAP process.
