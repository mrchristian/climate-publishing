 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The magnitude and pattern of the health risks of climate variability and change will shift as climate and development proceed, which will require revisiting the H-NAP to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness. Revisions to the H-NAP should also take into account experience gained with implementing adaptation options, knowledge gained from research, and changes in institutional structures. The updating process should be flexible, revisiting the H-NAP whenever major changes occur that could alter the previous conclusions and approaches to adaptation. An update should also be considered when the national adaptation plan is revised.</p>
