  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coordination between the health sector and the national adaptation planning process is necessary to do the following:
   <div list-type="simple" class="list">
    <div id="u0085" class="list-item">
     <span class="label">•</span>
     <p>Support integration of the health risks of climate variability and change into national adaptation plans and into national health planning processes.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u0090" class="list-item">
     <span class="label">•</span>

     <p>Coordinate the overall adaptation process.</p>

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The coordination between the Thailand Ministry of Health and the national adaptation planning led by the National Climate Change Committee is an example of this process. Furthermore, such coordination is critical to facilitate access to adaptation funds established by international donors and development partners to prepare for and manage the risks of climate variability and change. Health is underrepresented in these funds. A review of the inclusion of health within NAPAs concluded that 39 of 41 (95%) NAPAs identified health as a priority sector negatively affected by climate change, and 30 of 41 (73%) countries listed health interventions among their priority adaptation needs and proposed actions.
   <a rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib3">
    <span class="sup">3</span>
   </a> However, only approximately 4% of the portfolio of the Least Developed Countries Fund supported health adaptation. Having health represented in the overall national adaptation planning process could facilitate access to urgently needed adaptation funds to address current and projected health risks of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in 2014 that climate change has already contributed to levels of ill health and that major changes are projected across all emission pathways.
   <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">
    <span class="sup">4</span>
   </a> Lack of adaptation funding to address these risks will affect current and future population health, the foundation of national development.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taking stock of available information</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This step is essentially a situational analysis of the weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of climate variability and change to human health; knowledge of factors that could increase or decrease vulnerability to these risks (eg, vaccination and access to improved sanitation); adaptation policies and programs under way to manage climate-sensitive health outcomes (eg, national malaria control programs); and national and regional knowledge and capacity gaps necessary to address in the H-NAP process.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A critical challenge in many low- and middle-income countries is the limited data on climate-sensitive health outcomes, particularly the number of cases of nonreportable infectious diseases such as dengue fever or diarrheal disease. Even when data are available, there may be limited capacity to analyze the data to determine the magnitude and pattern of associations between weather and/or climate and health outcomes. For example, a series of studies in resource-poor settings were conducted to enhance understanding of the mortality effects of weather conditions in parts of Africa and Asia.
   <a rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib5">
    <span class="sup">5</span>
   </a> The INDEPTH network has been collecting high-quality standardized data on demographics and mortality for geographically defined populations over many years, resulting in high-quality registers representative of regions where such information is limited. For example, one of the studies focused on informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya, and found significant associations between extreme hot and cold temperatures, increasing amounts of rainfall, and deaths in children from infectious and noncommunicable diseases.
   <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">
    <span class="sup">6</span>
   </a> Across the 6 studies, children were the most vulnerable.
   <a rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib5">
    <span class="sup">5</span>
   </a> A 2012 study not only described the observed trends in temperature and rainfall in the study regions but also projected substantial shifts in a few study areas.
   <a rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib7">
    <span class="sup">7</span>
   </a> These results underscore the need for integrated surveillance to provide evidence of trends and the concern that the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes could increase significantly over coming decades. Such analyses can inform health adaptation policies and decision making, strengthening health systems to reduce these risks. However, human and financial resources are presently insufficient to expand networks such as INDEPTH or to develop new networks to conduct monitoring and surveillance for climate-sensitive health outcomes.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weather and climate information should also be identified in this step, including temperature data if heat-related morbidity and mortality are of concern and precipitation data for analyzing the associations between a wide range of infectious diseases and rainfall and flooding. This step can strengthen the collaborations between ministries of health, universities and other organizations, and national hydrometeorologic services and organizations. Early warning systems for climate-sensitive infectious diseases developed as part of a health adaptation project in the Kingdom of Bhutan are an example of a successful collaboration between the ministry of health and the national hydrometeorologic services.

    <span class="sup">8</span>
   </a> Another successful collaboration was established in China to effectively protect the health of vulnerable populations to heat stress (

Access to weather and climate data can be challenging in some countries, so promoting better collaborations early in the NAP process can be helpful.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identify approaches to address capacity gaps and weaknesses in undertaking the H-NAP process</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analyses conducted in the previous step will indicate whether additional efforts are needed to undertake the H-NAP process, such as identifying where augmentation of current data collection is needed to provide adequate evidence or where training is needed to conduct data analyses. Countries are just beginning to develop their H-NAPs, so it is expected that lessons learned and best practices in addressing capacity gaps will emerge over the next few years.</p>
