 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analyses conducted in the previous step will indicate whether additional efforts are needed to undertake the H-NAP process, such as identifying where augmentation of current data collection is needed to provide adequate evidence or where training is needed to conduct data analyses. Countries are just beginning to develop their H-NAPs, so it is expected that lessons learned and best practices in addressing capacity gaps will emerge over the next few years.</p>
