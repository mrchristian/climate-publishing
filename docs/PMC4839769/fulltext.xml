Previous modelling studies show that the global surface air temperature (SAT) response to deforestation depends on latitude, with most simulations showing that high latitude deforestation results in cooling, low latitude deforestation causes warming and that the mid latitude response is mixed. These earlier conclusions are based on simulated large scal land cover change, with complete removal of trees from whole latitude bands. Using a global climate model we examine the effects of removing fractions of 5% to 100% of forested areas in the high, mid and low latitudes. All high latitude deforestation scenarios reduce mean global SAT, the opposite occurring for low latitude deforestation, although a decrease in SAT is simulated over low latitude deforested areas. Mid latitude SAT response is mixed. In all simulations deforested areas tend to become drier and have lower SAT, although soil temperatures increase over deforested mid and low latitude grid cells. For high latitude deforestation fractions of 45% and above, larger net primary productivity, in conjunction with colder and drier conditions after deforestation cause an increase in soil carbon large enough to produce a net decrease of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Our results reveal the complex interactions between soil carbon dynamics and other climate subsystems in the energy partition responses to land cover change.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DG 140576948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beltrami</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Atlantic Computational Excellence Network (ACEnet-Compute Canada)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Longobardi</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by NSERC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/</ext-link>).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="17"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="34"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All data are deposited into Figshare (DOIs: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146257">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146257</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146263">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146263</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146260">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146260</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146254">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146254</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146251">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146251</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146212">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146212</ext-link>).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All data are deposited into Figshare (DOIs: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146257">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146257</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146263">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146263</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146260">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146260</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146254">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146254</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146251">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146251</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146212">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3146212</ext-link>).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Agricultural lands occupy approximately 38% of the Earth&#x02019;s land surface [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These croplands and pastures presently cover about 10%, 45% and 27% of the areas originally occupied by boreal, temperate, and tropical forests respectively [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Population growth and the associated expansion of agricultural lands is the primary cause of present day deforestation [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although rates of deforestation have decreased over the last decade, the loss of forested areas is expected to continue during the present century [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Forested area in the Amazon Basin, where the largest rainforest on Earth is found, could be reduced in approximately 50% by 2050.

With current population to agriculture density of &#x0223c; 147 people per km<sup>2</sup>, to meet the same quantity of food availability as present day, with no increases in productivity through technological advances, by 2100 agricultural areas would have to be increased by 43% [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Deforestation can impact climate on local and global scales by changes in the energy, mass and momentum fluxes between climate subsystems energy reservoirs. Deforestation is also associated with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, as crops and marginal lands that usually replace trees after land clearing tend to hold less carbon per unit area than forests [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The radiative forcing associated with an increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is, from a climatic perspective, the most important biogeochemical impact of deforestation. Increases in CO<sub>2</sub> also have the potential to affect climate by altering transpiration rates, due to CO<sub>2</sub> increased water use efficiency reducing stomatal conductance and increasing plant growth [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The biogeophysical impacts of deforestation most pertinent to climate are changes to surface albedo, evapotranspiration (ET) and surface roughness length [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Croplands and pastures tend to have higher albedo than forests, which causes them to absorb a smaller fraction of the incoming solar radiation. Trees tend to have deeper rooting depth than crops and grasses such that tree removal implies a decreased ET and associated reduction in latent heat flux [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], ET can also be reduced through the reduction in canopy capture following deforestation, as well as from reduced turbulence associated with a lower aerodynamic roughness length and colder temperatures. For large-scale land cover change the alterations in ET could influence cloud formation potentially impacting atmospheric albedo and atmospheric longwave absorption [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In previous modelling efforts, the net temperature response to deforestation, to a large extent, is determined by the magnitudes of these opposing warming (higher atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and lower latent heat flux) and cooling (increased albedo) effects (for some examples: [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). The albedo-related cooling is particularly important at mid to high latitudes, where the presence of snow exacerbates the differences in reflectivity between forests and fields [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], while the warming due to decreases in latent heat flux has a greater impact at low latitudes where the absolute changes in ET are larger [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Most modelling studies so far have analyzed the response to large-scale land cover change. In some, deforestation was global or performed over whole latitude bands [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] while others simulated global historical anthropogenic deforestation [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In general terms, these past simulations show that the temperature response of high latitude deforestation is still dominated by the albedo effect, resulting in a cooler climate. That is, while deforestation causes atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations to increase, the increment in albedo is enough to counteract greenhouse gas warming and yield a reduced surface air temperature (SAT). This cooling is global, and centered over the deforested areas [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Global temperature changes associated with mid latitude deforestation follow the same trend as for the high latitudes but with temperature changes of smaller magnitude [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Contrary to the cooling seen in the mid and high latitudes, simulated low latitude deforestation yields a warmer climate, with the increase in temperature attributed to the reduction in ET, and increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, which dominates the temperature signal [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Some studies have noted that a reduction in cloud cover, and hence, reduced atmospheric albedo over deforested regions was an important contributor to the modelled warming [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There have been indications from satellite based observations [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and modeling [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] efforts that the temperature response is dependent on the scale and location of land cover change. According to these studies, in many high latitude and mid latitude areas deforestation would result not in cooling but in net warming or no significant change as the CO<sub>2</sub> and ET induced energy gain overtakes the albedo induced losses.</p><p>Here we use a global climate model of intermediate complexity, with a coupled carbon cycle model, to determine to what degree the scale of deforestation may influence the climate system&#x02019;s response to high, mid and low latitude deforestation. This is done by a series of experiments, where deforestation fractions range from 5%-100% of the tree covered area over these distinct latitude bands. The simulations are conducted from 2011 to 2100 with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on the IPCC A2 scenario [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>1 Model Description</title><p>The University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM) version 2.9 is an intermediate complexity climate model with horizontal resolution of 1.8&#x000b0; (meridional) <italic>X</italic> 3.6&#x000b0; (zonal).

Based on a photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model, plant respiration and photosynthesis are dependent upon climate and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Through this, the response of vegetation to climate occurs via climate-induced changes in the vegetation to atmospheric fluxes of carbon [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In each 1.8&#x000b0;<italic>X</italic> 3.6&#x000b0; grid cell, changes to land coverage through time is determined by a dynamic competition between the different PFTs. This is based on the Lotka-Volterra approach and a tree-shrub-grass dominance hierarchy. TRIFFID also allows agricultural areas to exist. These areas are defined as croplands and are treated as grass PFTs for determining their biogeochemical and biophysical behaviors.</p><p>Due to the non-linear character of the Lotka-Volterra equations used for the competition algorithm, there exists a possibility for rapid loss of vegetation species if the land-use disturbance is large enough to trigger the requisite scenario. This scenario can produce rapid increases or decreases in the abundance of a species [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Soil carbon pools are increased through litterfall, and reduced by heterotrophic respiration Litterfall is calculated as an area weighted sum from each PFT, and is dependent upon the degree of the land disturbance and competition between PFTs. Respiration is determined by the soil carbon content, a q<sub>10</sub> soil temperature equation, and a piecewise linear soil moisture function [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In general terms this means that higher NPP results in an increase in the rate with which carbon is added to the soil with higher soil temperatures and moisture resulting in increases in respiration and hence in the rate of soil carbon decrease. Soil temperature, moisture and carbon content represent values from the model&#x02019;s single one meter deep layer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>2 Experiments</title><p>For all experiments, the model is integrated from equilibrium at year 1800 to year 2000 forced by historical CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from combustion of fossil fuels and land-use change [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

Deforestation is simulated separately in three bands: the area northward of 40&#x000b0;N (high latitudes), the areas between 20&#x000b0;N to 40&#x000b0;N, and 20&#x000b0;S to 40&#x000b0;S (mid latitudes) and the area between 20&#x000b0;S to 20&#x000b0;N (low latitudes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g001">Fig 1</xref>). While the adoption of latitudinal bands is our best attempt to represent impacts of deforestation on different environments, it must be noted that, as TRIFFID only contains five PFTS, the type of vegetation cover present in each latitude band is a very simple and incomplete representations of existing biomes, which are not only more complex but also distributed over the landscape space in complex patterns dictated by many other factors in addition to latitude.</p><fig id="pone.0153357.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0153357.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>2010 Forest Coverage.</title><p>Coverage is represented as fractional amount of broadleaf and needleleaf trees in each grid cell.

The vegetation is specified by a land cover data set [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. All results are compared to a control run where the crop area fraction remained fixed at the 2010 distribution. In the deforestation experiments crop area fraction is increased by different amounts in order to generate arbitrary deforestation ranging from 5% to 100% of the total forested area of the three different latitudes at 2010. The land cover change is performed in a single step at the start of 2011 by substituting trees with crops.</p><p>In all but the 100% deforestation scenario only grid cells that contain both crops and forests are defined as eligible for deforestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In these simulations deforestation is performed by reducing the forest cover by a fixed amount in all eligible grid cells. The rationale is that experiments should simulate, as well as the coarse spatial scale of the model allows, land cover change resulting from an expansion in agricultural areas. In the 100% scenario, any grid cell with forests was deemed eligible for deforestation. There is no 75% deforestation simulation for the high latitudes, as the requirements for deforestation did not allow sufficient grid cells to be used to reach the required forest loss.</p><fig id="pone.0153357.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0153357.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><p>Grid cells eligible for deforestation in the high (top row), mid (middle row) and low latitudes (bottom row) in the non 100% simulations (left column) and 100% simulations (right column).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0153357.g002"/></fig><p>The expansion of croplands in the model follows a hierarchy where grasslands are converted to crops, before shrubs and trees. The result is that eligible grid cells that contain grasslands and shrubs prior to deforestation have these fractions converted to crops as well at the start of 2011. It should be noted that in TRIFFID crops and grasslands have identical biogeochemical and biogeophysical characteristics. The only difference is that grasslands can be outcompeted by other plant functional types while the crop distribution is prescribed. This means that all areas converted to crops in 2011 remain as such until the end of the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>3 Results</title><p>After the initial disturbance the remaining forest cover is free to change according to the vegetation model&#x02019;s response to climate.

It is this loss of trees in the deforested bins which produces the converging trend observed in the 25%-75% simulations, as their forest coverage in the deforested bins is near identical. Some regrowth occurs in the non-deforested bins, where the forested fraction increases in relationship to the control for all simulations. This further loss of trees is not related to the dynamic vegetation model responding to climatic changes brought by deforestation but occurs because of the response of the competition algorithms adopted by TRIFFID to the large and rapid land cover change implemented at 2011. Following the large land-use change, and subsequent changes to climate, TRIFFID&#x02019;s competition algorithm produced a continual loss of forests in the disturbed bins, with these forests being primarily replaced by shrubs. In that sense, the observed continuos loss of forest cover after deforestation are more akin to an external forcing to the simulations than to a response of the vegetation model to environmental change. Since our goal is to evaluate the climatic response to vegetation change and not vice-versa we feel that the continuous loss of forest resulting from this limitation of the competition algorithms do not invalidate our analysis and results.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>3.2 Temperature and Moisture Response</title><p>The modeled temperature and carbon cycle responses to deforestation are intrinsically linked, complicating our choice of what to present and discuss first.

As with the mid latitudes, the changes in soil carbon are explained by continuous increase in carbon density over non-deforested areas and a mixed response in the deforested bins. The largest soil carbon losses occur in the intermediary deforestation fractions, where soils are warmer and not as dry. Different from the high and mid latitudes, these losses resulted in periods where some intermediary fractions, like the 25% scenario, exhibited global changes soil carbon near zero. Again as seen in the high and mid latitudes, the experiments with the smaller soil carbon anomalies are the ones which show the largest concentrations of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Increases in NPP, relatively colder temperatures and drier conditions lead to large soil carbon gains by deforested bins in the higher fraction deforestation scenarios. Similarly to the mid latitudes, the deforested bins of the 75% and 100% simulations hold the majority of the global soil carbon by the end of the experiments.</p><p>The ocean carbon response to low latitude deforestation is very similar to the high and mid latitudes, where ocean carbon to a certain degree mirrors atmospheric carbon. In the low latitudes we do not see the same level of post initial pulse reduction in atmospheric carbon as was observed in the high and mid latitudes, and the ocean carbon also shows this, as there is less variation in total ocean carbon between the simulations, due to the oceans slower response to atmospheric carbon change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>4 Discussion</title><p>The use of a model of intermediate complexity in the study of deforestation has some drawbacks, among the more evident, the lack of a cloud response, which is expected to play a larger role in low-latitude deforestation.

Differently from these earlier results, our cooling is magnified in the 45%-100% scenarios by a decrease in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> caused largely by an accumulation of soil carbon over deforested areas. By 2100 our 100% simulation produced cooling of approximately 0.4 K, with an average cooling over the duration of the simulation of 0.33 K. The average cooling is similar to what was found by previous experiments where a cooling of 0.25 K is observed [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but at 2100 we obtained cooling that was only about half of what is modeled by other simulations [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In terms of albedo, we detected high-latitude increases ranging from 2.02% to 12.74% by 2100, with larger deforestation events producing higher increases in albedo.

However, the 75% and 100% experiments show higher initial albedo increase, as well as reduced atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> through increased soil carbon, driving further global cooling. The rapid increase in albedo in the 75% and 100% scenarios effect the soil temperatures as well, which decrease over the first 60 years, before the temperature anomalies begin to trend upwards again. This points to the importance of the magnitude of the initial disturbance on modelled climates. Although the 25%-75% scenarios all reach similar forest loss by 2100, and display converging albedo values, the larger initial land use change results in higher initial albedo values which allow the 45%-75% simulations to reach lower temperatures despite having final land use change fractions similar to the 25% simulations.</p><p>In the mid latitudes, the local response to deforestation differs compared to the high latitudes. The increase in ET leads to more drying than what is observed in the high latitudes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g015">15</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g016">16</xref>).

Soil temperatures increase, despite the added cooling from increased modelled outgoing latent heat and albedo, primarily due to the decreased roughness length following deforestation. Decreased roughness lengths lead to less outgoing sensible heat, which becomes the dominant driver in local soil temperatures for these experiments. Following deforestation the outgoing sensible heat flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g016">Fig 16</xref>) decreases more than at the high latitudes, resulting in a higher retention of heat in the soils, and thus higher soil temperatures.</p><fig id="pone.0153357.g016" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0153357.g016</object-id><label>Fig 16</label><caption><p>Annually averaged outgoing surface energy flux anomalies over deforested areas for mid latitude deforestation.

Soil temperatures were larger in the low latitudes, and conditions were wetter than the mid latitudes. It is likely this difference in climate that causes the larger reduction in local soil carbon, in the 5%-45% scenarios than the mid latitude cases.

This change in behaviour, as well as warmer soil temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g011">Fig 11</xref>), can account for the increased respiration relative to carbon drawdown, and hence the decreased local soil carbon in these experiments.</p><p>Local soil warming occurs due to the same energy balance modifications seen in the mid latitudes, with higher temperatures related to a decrease in outgoing sensible heat flux that overcomes the increase in outgoing net radiative and latent heat fluxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g017">Fig 17</xref>). The higher local soil temperature anomalies present in the low latitudes, occur due to the larger reductions in outgoing sensible heat, as well as increased rates of change in the energy budget of the soils, than what is seen in the mid latitudes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g016">16</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g017">17</xref>). The increase in outgoing latent heat flux and reduction in sensible heat flux, also explains the lower SATs over deforested areas in the low latitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0153357.g017" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0153357.g017</object-id><label>Fig 17</label><caption><p>Annually averaged outgoing surface energy flux anomalies over deforested areas for low latitude deforestation.

Although NPP increases due to the forest-to-cropland conversion, this is not enough to overcome the changes in respiration, where consistently higher soil temperatures, as well as less drying than is observed in the mid latitudes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g009">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g012">12</xref>), lead to a larger reduction in local soil carbon. However our 50%-100% simulations present the same response as our high and mid latitude results, where local soil carbon increases. This highlights the importance of the initial magnitude of land use change, and resultant climate change, on the soil carbon response to deforestation in the UVic ESCM. The 15%-75% simulations all have converging levels of forest loss by 2100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g003">Fig 3</xref>), thus the rate of change of land cover can also play a role in soil carbon retention. This further enhances the argument that the change in soil carbon arises through a multitude of pathways, which influence the influx and outflux of carbon.</p><p>The increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, and warmer temperatures seen in our low latitude simulations, are climatic effects more often associated with modelled deforestation. Even then, due mostly to the soil carbon response, CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature increases are not proportional to deforested area. Seeing as how the location and scale of deforestation can lead to either an increase or decrease to local and global soil carbon, our results call attention to the subtleties of this response and toward a need for a better understanding the complexity of soil carbon dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>5 Summary and Conclusions</title><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><underline>Global SAT response</underline>. High-latitude deforestation leads to cooling proportional to deforested area. Removing trees over the low latitudes causes warming but due to an increase in albedo and increase in the soil carbon pool (see below) this warming is reduced in experiments with large initial deforestation fraction. The SAT response of mid-latitude deforestation is small compared to the other two bands with intermediary deforestation fractions causing warming and larger fractions cooling.</p></list-item><list-item><p><underline>SAT response over deforested areas</underline>. Albedo driven cooling is observed for all latitude bands and all initial deforestation fractions.</p></list-item><list-item><p><underline>The importance of soil carbon</underline>. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and consequently the global temperature response to deforestation, are greatly influenced by post-disturbance changes in soil carbon pools inside and outside deforested areas. It is in large part due to an increase in soil carbon over deforested areas that, irrespective of latitude band, larger initial deforestation scenarios show lower final atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations than intermediate scenarios. Given the large uncertainties associated with the modelled terrestrial carbon cycle [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], our results also point to the need for greater understanding of how organic matter behaves in soils [<xref rid="pone.0153357.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and for the adoption of this new knowledge by terrestrial models.</p></list-item><list-item><p><underline>Pattern and drivers of soil carbon change</underline>. Larger NPP, due mostly to CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization, is the cause of soil carbon increase over non-deforested areas. In the high-latitude experiments non-deforested areas also gain carbon due to colder and dryer conditions. In the mid- and low-latitude experiments deforested area soils become warmer and dryer, with moisture effects overcoming the opposing temperature impacts and leading to net soil carbon gain, particularly for the higher deforestation fraction scenarios, where local soil temperatures do not increase as much. Among experiments that end up with similar total deforested area, those with larger initial deforestation fractions tend to show larger soil carbon gains and consequently relatively cooler temperatures, an indication that the rate of land cover change is an important determinant of the model&#x02019;s response to deforestation.</p></list-item><list-item><p><underline>Drivers of soil temperature change over deforested areas</underline>. At high latitudes the tendency is for cooling due to the increase in albedo. In both mid and low latitudes the response is warming caused by a post-deforestation reduction in sensible heat flux.</p></list-item><list-item><p><underline>Clouds and low-latitude deforestation</underline>. The local cooling recorded by our experiments is not seen in simulations of low-latitude deforestation conducted by models that incorporate cloud dynamics. Reliable predictions of the effects of deforestation require understanding the cloud response to land cover change, a problem with yet many uncertainties.</p></list-item></list>
