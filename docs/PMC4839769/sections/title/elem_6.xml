 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the initial disturbance the remaining forest cover is free to change according to the vegetation model’s response to climate. In presenting and discussing our results, experiments are classified according to their initial arbitrary deforestation fraction. For example, the 5% experiment refers to the simulation in which 5% of the forest cover was removed instantaneously at the start of 2011. Average SAT, soil temperature and P-E values for the 2090-2100 decade and their 95% confidence intervals are presented in Tables

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g003" href="#pone.0153357.g003">Fig 3</a>). In all experiments, the fraction of forest loss of the 25%-75% simulations tends to converge to around 50% in the high latitudes, 70% in the mid latitudes and 80% in the low latitudes. The 5% and 15% scenarios, continue to loose forests up to the end of the simulations. Pre-deforestation forest cover is identical for all experiments. The initial and continued forest loss percentages are based on this original, pre-deforestation value.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all cases, the post-deforestation dieback is caused by further forest loss in the deforested bins, which in the more extensive deforestation scenarios tend to lose all of their trees. It is this loss of trees in the deforested bins which produces the converging trend observed in the 25%-75% simulations, as their forest coverage in the deforested bins is near identical. Some regrowth occurs in the non-deforested bins, where the forested fraction increases in relationship to the control for all simulations. This further loss of trees is not related to the dynamic vegetation model responding to climatic changes brought by deforestation but occurs because of the response of the competition algorithms adopted by TRIFFID to the large and rapid land cover change implemented at 2011. Following the large land-use change, and subsequent changes to climate, TRIFFID’s competition algorithm produced a continual loss of forests in the disturbed bins, with these forests being primarily replaced by shrubs. In that sense, the observed continuos loss of forest cover after deforestation are more akin to an external forcing to the simulations than to a response of the vegetation model to environmental change. Since our goal is to evaluate the climatic response to vegetation change and not vice-versa we feel that the continuous loss of forest resulting from this limitation of the competition algorithms do not invalidate our analysis and results.</p>

    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g004" href="#pone.0153357.g004">Fig 4</a>). The reduction in temperature is magnified at higher latitudes due to an increase in snow and ice cover and consequent increase in albedo. In the 100% scenario the average temperature change from 20°N to 40°N was -0.42K and the temperature change from 40°N and above was -0.78K. Lower atmospheric CO
    <sub>2</sub> values are also responsible for some of the larger cooling seen in the 45% and 100% deforestation simulations (see Section 4). Deforestation also causes a decrease in global and local soil temperature (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g005" href="#pone.0153357.g005">Fig 5</a>—The term local refers to area weighted averages over the initially deforested grid cells), however soil temperatures become warmer in areas with large forest cover prior to deforestation (

Our simulations indicate that contrary to the areas that become wetter in the mid latitudes simulations, the positive P-E anomalies in the low latitude deforested bins are caused by an increase in precipitation and not decreased ET.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared to the mid latitudes, where the wetter conditions occur in areas of mixed warming and cooling soil temperatures, low latitude bins with positive P-E show no significant variation in soil temperature (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g011" href="#pone.0153357.g011">Fig 11</a>). From 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g012" href="#pone.0153357.g012">Fig 12</a> (bottom) it can be seen that there is an increase in P-E outside the deforested areas. This increase is not exclusive to the 100% deforestation shown, being seen in all scenarios. It is this increase in moisture in non-deforested areas, as well as the less pronounced decrease in moisture in the deforested areas for the 5%-45% simulations, that leads to an average global increase of moisture over land at various times in the simulations for the 15%-45% scenarios.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Atmospheric carbon closely mirrors the changes to land carbon—the sum of soil and vegetation carbon. CO
    <sub>2</sub> levels are higher in experiments where deforestation leads to net loss of carbon by the land reservoir and lower in simulations where the removal of trees cause an increase in land carbon stocks (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>). Deforestation always results in an decrease in vegetation carbon and an increase in the soil carbon pool. Some of this increase takes place over non-deforested areas where, for high- mid- and low-latitude deforestation, NPP increases due to changes in climate and the CO
    <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect. The net change in the land carbon pool, and consequently the atmospheric CO
    <sub>2</sub> response, is determined by the relative magnitude of these soil and vegetation carbon changes.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ignoring the small drawdowns of the 5% experiment, deforestation of up to 25% results in losses in the land carbon pool and increase in atmospheric carbon (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>). For the 45%-100% deforestation scenarios the increase in soil carbon overcomes the losses from vegetation carbon. In these simulations the land gains carbon at the expense of the atmosphere, where CO
    <sub>2</sub> concentrations decrease (

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increase in soil carbon is related to a reduction in soil heterotrophic respiration due to colder and drier conditions and also to an increase in modelled net primary productivity (NPP) over deforested areas (not shown and caused by the higher modeled NPP of grasslands compared to forests in these latitudes). In the 5%-25% simulations the increase in soil carbon was larger in the non-deforested areas than in the deforested areas. We interpret this as an indication that climate played a larger role than alterations in NPP due to land cover change in the increase of soil carbon in these experiments. Deforested areas contribute to approximately 58%-70% of the increase in soil carbon in the 45%-100% deforestation scenarios, showing that in these experiments the higher NPP of croplands also played a role in accumulation of land carbon. Although croplands are usually associated with reductions in NPP, observations have found an increase in NPP after forest loss in high latitudes [
    <a rid="pone.0153357.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref046">46</a>], and modeling efforts have found an increase due to higher grassland productivity and CO

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all scenarios, deforestation produces a rapid increase in atmospheric CO
    <sub>2</sub> (2 to 47 ppmv) as the carbon lost by vegetation due to deforestation makes its way into the atmosphere (Figs

    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">14</a>). This is followed again, in all scenarios, by a decrease in CO
    <sub>2</sub> values. After this initial pulse, the behaviour of the simulations differs. The 5%-25% scenarios show increases relative to the initial post pulse value up to year 2100. CO
    <sub>2</sub> concentrations remain near the post-pulse value for 45% experiment while the 75% and 100% scenarios, in similar fashion to the high latitude case, exhibit continuos reductions in atmospheric CO

    <sub>2</sub> are not large enough to generate negative anomalies by the end of the century.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All simulations experience a global increase in soil carbon that offsets a portion of the losses in land carbon caused by deforestation and dieback. Following a brief (about four years) initial decrease in soil carbon, all experiments show a relatively rapid increase of carbon in this pool up to about 2040 to 2060. The magnitude of the increase is dependent on the deforestation fraction and in all experiments this is accompanied by a reduction in atmospheric carbon (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For all experiments, both forested and non-forested bins contribute to the initial increase in soil carbon. Due to changes in climate and enhanced NPP caused by increased atmospheric CO

As simulations progress, some scenarios experience eventual reductions in soil carbon, associated with loss of carbon in deforested bins. These losses are larger for the 15%-25% scenarios, (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>) and are associated with increased respiration, due to warmer soil temperatures (

The increase in NPP, as well as the enhanced drying and cooler temperatures over the deforested bins of the 75% and 100% experiments causes these areas to gain soil carbon continuously during the experiments.

As with the mid latitudes, the changes in soil carbon are explained by continuous increase in carbon density over non-deforested areas and a mixed response in the deforested bins. The largest soil carbon losses occur in the intermediary deforestation fractions, where soils are warmer and not as dry. Different from the high and mid latitudes, these losses resulted in periods where some intermediary fractions, like the 25% scenario, exhibited global changes soil carbon near zero. Again as seen in the high and mid latitudes, the experiments with the smaller soil carbon anomalies are the ones which show the largest concentrations of atmospheric CO
    <sub>2</sub>. Increases in NPP, relatively colder temperatures and drier conditions lead to large soil carbon gains by deforested bins in the higher fraction deforestation scenarios. Similarly to the mid latitudes, the deforested bins of the 75% and 100% simulations hold the majority of the global soil carbon by the end of the experiments.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ocean carbon response to low latitude deforestation is very similar to the high and mid latitudes, where ocean carbon to a certain degree mirrors atmospheric carbon. In the low latitudes we do not see the same level of post initial pulse reduction in atmospheric carbon as was observed in the high and mid latitudes, and the ocean carbon also shows this, as there is less variation in total ocean carbon between the simulations, due to the oceans slower response to atmospheric carbon change (
