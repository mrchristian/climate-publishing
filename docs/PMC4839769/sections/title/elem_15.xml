  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All deforestation simulations show an initial increase in atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> relative to the control. The increase is proportional to deforested area and ranges from 3 to 50 ppmv (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g013" href="#pone.0153357.g013">Fig 13</a>, top). This expected increase in CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration is due to the release of carbon stored in the forests [

   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref045">45</a>]. Although the relative difference between the simulations and the control decreases in the first 10 years after deforestation, atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> values for the 15% and 25% deforestation experiments remain above those of the control during the whole simulation due to continued, competition algorithm induced, loss of forests leading to increased CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions. For the 45%-100% deforestation experiments however, the post-deforestation pulse reduction in CO
   <sub>2</sub> is such that from about year 2040 onward these scenarios’ atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations are lower than those of the control (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Atmospheric carbon closely mirrors the changes to land carbon—the sum of soil and vegetation carbon. CO
   <sub>2</sub> levels are higher in experiments where deforestation leads to net loss of carbon by the land reservoir and lower in simulations where the removal of trees cause an increase in land carbon stocks (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>). Deforestation always results in an decrease in vegetation carbon and an increase in the soil carbon pool. Some of this increase takes place over non-deforested areas where, for high- mid- and low-latitude deforestation, NPP increases due to changes in climate and the CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect. The net change in the land carbon pool, and consequently the atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> response, is determined by the relative magnitude of these soil and vegetation carbon changes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ignoring the small drawdowns of the 5% experiment, deforestation of up to 25% results in losses in the land carbon pool and increase in atmospheric carbon (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>). For the 45%-100% deforestation scenarios the increase in soil carbon overcomes the losses from vegetation carbon. In these simulations the land gains carbon at the expense of the atmosphere, where CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations decrease (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increase in soil carbon is related to a reduction in soil heterotrophic respiration due to colder and drier conditions and also to an increase in modelled net primary productivity (NPP) over deforested areas (not shown and caused by the higher modeled NPP of grasslands compared to forests in these latitudes). In the 5%-25% simulations the increase in soil carbon was larger in the non-deforested areas than in the deforested areas. We interpret this as an indication that climate played a larger role than alterations in NPP due to land cover change in the increase of soil carbon in these experiments. Deforested areas contribute to approximately 58%-70% of the increase in soil carbon in the 45%-100% deforestation scenarios, showing that in these experiments the higher NPP of croplands also played a role in accumulation of land carbon. Although croplands are usually associated with reductions in NPP, observations have found an increase in NPP after forest loss in high latitudes [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref046">46</a>], and modeling efforts have found an increase due to higher grassland productivity and CO
   <sub>2</sub>-fertilization despite colder temperatures [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all scenarios, deforestation produces a rapid increase in atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> (2 to 47 ppmv) as the carbon lost by vegetation due to deforestation makes its way into the atmosphere (Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g013" href="#pone.0153357.g013">13</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">14</a>). This is followed again, in all scenarios, by a decrease in CO
   <sub>2</sub> values. After this initial pulse, the behaviour of the simulations differs. The 5%-25% scenarios show increases relative to the initial post pulse value up to year 2100. CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations remain near the post-pulse value for 45% experiment while the 75% and 100% scenarios, in similar fashion to the high latitude case, exhibit continuos reductions in atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> after the initial peak. Contrary to the high latitudes simulations these reductions in atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> are not large enough to generate negative anomalies by the end of the century.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All simulations experience a global increase in soil carbon that offsets a portion of the losses in land carbon caused by deforestation and dieback. Following a brief (about four years) initial decrease in soil carbon, all experiments show a relatively rapid increase of carbon in this pool up to about 2040 to 2060. The magnitude of the increase is dependent on the deforestation fraction and in all experiments this is accompanied by a reduction in atmospheric carbon (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For all experiments, both forested and non-forested bins contribute to the initial increase in soil carbon. Due to changes in climate and enhanced NPP caused by increased atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref047">47</a>], non-deforested bins maintain positive soil carbon anomalies over the duration of all experiments. As simulations progress, some scenarios experience eventual reductions in soil carbon, associated with loss of carbon in deforested bins. These losses are larger for the 15%-25% scenarios, (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>) and are associated with increased respiration, due to warmer soil temperatures (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g008" href="#pone.0153357.g008">Fig 8</a>) and wetter conditions over their deforested bins when compared to those of the other scenarios (Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g006" href="#pone.0153357.g006">6</a>, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g009" href="#pone.0153357.g009">9</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g012" href="#pone.0153357.g012">12</a>). The increase in NPP, as well as the enhanced drying and cooler temperatures over the deforested bins of the 75% and 100% experiments causes these areas to gain soil carbon continuously during the experiments. The large increase of soil carbon in the higher deforestation fraction experiments leads to the larger atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> drawdown seen in these scenarios.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As in the other latitudinal bands, the carbon lost by vegetation due to tree removal over the low latitudes enters the atmosphere, generating a rapid increase in CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations proportional to the extent of deforestation (7 to 127 ppmv). Due to the larger quantity of trees removed in the low latitudes, this initial CO
   <sub>2</sub> increase is higher than what is seen in the high and mid latitudes combined (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g013" href="#pone.0153357.g013">Fig 13</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This increase is followed by a period of diminishing CO
   <sub>2</sub>, with the rate of decrease proportional to the deforestation fraction caused mostly by oceanic absorption of CO
   <sub>2</sub>. Atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> values in the 75% and 100% scenarios fall relatively quickly, and for the duration of the experiments, remain below those of the initial peak. This is not the case for the other scenarios, where by no later than the mid 21
   <span class="sup">
    <span class="italic">st</span>
   </span> century, the atmosphere holds more carbon than it had at the peak of the post deforestation pulse (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g013" href="#pone.0153357.g013">Fig 13</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The low latitudes had the same initial soil carbon response to deforestation as the high and mid latitudes, with a small initial decrease over the first few years followed by a rapid increase (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>). As with the mid latitudes, the changes in soil carbon are explained by continuous increase in carbon density over non-deforested areas and a mixed response in the deforested bins. The largest soil carbon losses occur in the intermediary deforestation fractions, where soils are warmer and not as dry. Different from the high and mid latitudes, these losses resulted in periods where some intermediary fractions, like the 25% scenario, exhibited global changes soil carbon near zero. Again as seen in the high and mid latitudes, the experiments with the smaller soil carbon anomalies are the ones which show the largest concentrations of atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub>. Increases in NPP, relatively colder temperatures and drier conditions lead to large soil carbon gains by deforested bins in the higher fraction deforestation scenarios. Similarly to the mid latitudes, the deforested bins of the 75% and 100% simulations hold the majority of the global soil carbon by the end of the experiments.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ocean carbon response to low latitude deforestation is very similar to the high and mid latitudes, where ocean carbon to a certain degree mirrors atmospheric carbon. In the low latitudes we do not see the same level of post initial pulse reduction in atmospheric carbon as was observed in the high and mid latitudes, and the ocean carbon also shows this, as there is less variation in total ocean carbon between the simulations, due to the oceans slower response to atmospheric carbon change (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>).
