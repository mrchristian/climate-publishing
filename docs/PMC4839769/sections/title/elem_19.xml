 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of a model of intermediate complexity in the study of deforestation has some drawbacks, among the more evident, the lack of a cloud response, which is expected to play a larger role in low-latitude deforestation. Still due to computational and time constraints, the large number of experiments required by the project could only be conducted with this kind of model.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lower temperatures observed in our 5%-25% deforestation experiments are in agreement with previous modelling studies where the albedo effect outweighs the increase in CO
   <sub>2</sub> for high latitude deforestation [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>]. Differently from these earlier results, our cooling is magnified in the 45%-100% scenarios by a decrease in atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> caused largely by an accumulation of soil carbon over deforested areas. By 2100 our 100% simulation produced cooling of approximately 0.4 K, with an average cooling over the duration of the simulation of 0.33 K. The average cooling is similar to what was found by previous experiments where a cooling of 0.25 K is observed [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>], but at 2100 we obtained cooling that was only about half of what is modeled by other simulations [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. In terms of albedo, we detected high-latitude increases ranging from 2.02% to 12.74% by 2100, with larger deforestation events producing higher increases in albedo. This is higher than the 10.7% increase of high latitude albedo at 2100 obtained by earlier efforts [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. When global albedo is considered, our average increases of 0.01 to 0.04 are smaller than what was observed by other experiments that reported a global average increase of 0.07 [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>]. It is likely that the discrepancies between our results and these past efforts are at least partly due to differences in the selection of the latitudinal ranges used by the different experiments [

   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>]. Another set of previous experiments, while not reporting changes in soil carbon, find a similar (5 ppm at 2100) increase in atmospheric CO

   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. It must be noted that one of these experiments did not account for anthropogenic emissions [

   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref048">48</a>]. At particular temperate zone sites conversion of forests to cropland resulted in about a 32% ±20% decrease in soil carbon and the conversion of grassland to forest caused soil carbon

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The initial surface air and soil cooling of the 45%-100% experiments are markedly larger (Figs

It is this rapid albedo-related cooling, and the associated slow down of soil respiration, which lead to the larger retention of carbon over land in these scenarios. As the surface albedo and atmospheric CO

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Removal of trees shortens the roughness length and causes a reduction in outgoing sensible heat flux, a warming effect, over deforested bins. At the same time, deforested areas—due to an increase in modeled evaporation—experience increases in the outgoing latent heat flux and a decrease in shortwave absorption. The final result is a reduction in net incoming energy and soil cooling (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g015" href="#pone.0153357.g015">Fig 15</a>). In a similar way, high-latitude deforestation has been observed to cause local cooling despite a decreased outgoing sensible heat flux [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reduction in soil moisture, while less important in explaining the initial accumulation of soil carbon, is likely exerting a larger influence after about 2060, when soil carbon continues to increase (albeit at slower rates) in spite of increasing soil temperature over deforested areas (Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g005" href="#pone.0153357.g005">5</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">14</a>). In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g006" href="#pone.0153357.g006">Fig 6</a>, an interesting result is shown where the drying in the 100% simulation isn’t the largest, compared to the temperature and carbon response, where the 100% scenario produces the most extreme changes. The increased moisture is likely due to the larger area used for 100% deforestation, with more snow covered areas and more cooling resulting in less ET. This result can also be observed in (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g015" href="#pone.0153357.g015">Fig 15</a>) where the latent heat flux of the 100% simulation is less than the 45% and 50% scenarios for the majority of the simulation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidently, we don’t make the claim that our findings justify large scale high latitude deforestation as a means of carbon sequestration. Nevertheless, our results point to the complex interaction between soil carbon dynamics and climate and the significant role this interaction plays on the modelled climatic response to land cover change.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SAT cooling seen in the 100% mid latitude deforestation scenario is in general agreement with previous studies [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref025">25</a>], albeit the 0.077 K reduction in temperature at 2100 recorded by our experiments is larger than the 0.04 K cooling produced by comparable simulations [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. Our experiments generated albedo increases of 1% to 5%, within the range range of earlier efforts that found increases of 4.7% to 5% [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By 2100 the 75% scenario has near identical forest loss as the 25% and 45%. However, the 75% and 100% experiments show higher initial albedo increase, as well as reduced atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> through increased soil carbon, driving further global cooling. The rapid increase in albedo in the 75% and 100% scenarios effect the soil temperatures as well, which decrease over the first 60 years, before the temperature anomalies begin to trend upwards again. This points to the importance of the magnitude of the initial disturbance on modelled climates. Although the 25%-75% scenarios all reach similar forest loss by 2100, and display converging albedo values, the larger initial land use change results in higher initial albedo values which allow the 45%-75% simulations to reach lower temperatures despite having final land use change fractions similar to the 25% simulations.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the mid latitudes, the local response to deforestation differs compared to the high latitudes. The increase in ET leads to more drying than what is observed in the high latitudes (Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g006" href="#pone.0153357.g006">6</a>, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g009" href="#pone.0153357.g009">9</a>,

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g016" href="#pone.0153357.g016">16</a>). This is also accompanied by increased soil temperatures in the mid latitude deforested bins, opposed to the local response to high latitude deforestation (Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g005" href="#pone.0153357.g005">5</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g008" href="#pone.0153357.g008">8</a>). Soil temperatures increase, despite the added cooling from increased modelled outgoing latent heat and albedo, primarily due to the decreased roughness length following deforestation. Decreased roughness lengths lead to less outgoing sensible heat, which becomes the dominant driver in local soil temperatures for these experiments. Following deforestation the outgoing sensible heat flux (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g016" href="#pone.0153357.g016">Fig 16</a>) decreases more than at the high latitudes, resulting in a higher retention of heat in the soils, and thus higher soil temperatures.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The accumulation of global soil carbon is driven by the increase in NPP and a decrease in soil respiration. The change in soil carbon accumulation is intrinsically tied to the change in soil temperature and moisture. Globally, all deforestation fractions led to drier conditions over land, and global soil temperatures tend to decrease, the exception being the 15% and 25% scenarios (Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g009" href="#pone.0153357.g009">9</a> and

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The opposing effects of warming and drying trends determines the exchange of carbon between soil and atmosphere. The 15% and 25% scenarios experience the largest local warming, however do not experience the same level of drying as is seen in the 45%-100% scenarios. The 45%-100% scenarios also experience less warming then the 15% and 25% scenarios, leading to reduced respiration in the 45%-100% cases and larger drawdown of atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub>. This results in larger soil carbon quantities and less atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> (Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g013" href="#pone.0153357.g013">13</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">14</a>). The increase in CO
   <sub>2</sub> seen in the 5%-25% simulations is linked to the less rapid loss of forests than was seen in the 45%-100% scenarios, resulting in less albedo cooling, and a slower release of CO
   <sub>2</sub> over time. The warmer global soil temperatures of the 15% and 25% scenarios are due to the higher surface air temperatures, where increased CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations, as well as lower surface albedos than the 45%-100% scenarios, highlighting the complex interactions which take place in determining local and global temperatures.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference between these studies is likely due to the different carbon and albedo responses, as well as some of the inherent differences in the models used. By 2100 our 100% scenario had an increased CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration of ∼ 66.5 ppm, while comparable experiments resulted in an increase of 199 ppm [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. Another difference is that previous studies [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite based studies show that that depending upon the scale of deforestation, cloud cover may not change and may even increase over disturbed areas [

   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>] and may lead to added cooling not accounted for in these modelling studies. One of these previous efforts [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>] found that the net albedo change over the deforested regions was negligible as the increase in surface albedo was compensated by the decrease in atmospheric albedo, and suggests that cloud cover may play a major role in tropical climates.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clouds cover is prescribed in the UVic ESCM and in our experiments the post-deforestation surface albedo increase is not compensated by a decrease in atmospheric albedo due to a reduction in cloud cover over deforested areas. This helps explains the local cooling registered by our simulations and lends support to the argument that a reduction in cloud cover is an important component of the modelled temperature response to deforestation in the tropics see in previous experiments.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Low latitude deforestation has been associated with a decrease in modelled total land carbon [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>], and the same occurs in all of our simulations (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>). The same authors [
   <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>] also see a reduction in soil carbon in the deforested areas, and increases in the non-deforested areas, which is observed in our 5%-45% scenarios, but is in disagreement with our 50%-100% experiments where we record an increase in soil carbon in all locations, regardless of land cover change. Soil temperatures were larger in the low latitudes, and conditions were wetter than the mid latitudes. It is likely this difference in climate that causes the larger reduction in local soil carbon, in the 5%-45% scenarios than the mid latitude cases. During the simulations the 5%-25% scenarios become wetter, relative to their initial drying following deforestation (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g012" href="#pone.0153357.g012">Fig 12</a>). This change in behaviour, as well as warmer soil temperatures (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g011" href="#pone.0153357.g011">Fig 11</a>), can account for the increased respiration relative to carbon drawdown, and hence the decreased local soil carbon in these experiments.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local soil warming occurs due to the same energy balance modifications seen in the mid latitudes, with higher temperatures related to a decrease in outgoing sensible heat flux that overcomes the increase in outgoing net radiative and latent heat fluxes (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g017" href="#pone.0153357.g017">Fig 17</a>). The higher local soil temperature anomalies present in the low latitudes, occur due to the larger reductions in outgoing sensible heat, as well as increased rates of change in the energy budget of the soils, than what is seen in the mid latitudes (Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g016" href="#pone.0153357.g016">16</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g017" href="#pone.0153357.g017">17</a>). The increase in outgoing latent heat flux and reduction in sensible heat flux, also explains the lower SATs over deforested areas in the low latitudes (

Although NPP increases due to the forest-to-cropland conversion, this is not enough to overcome the changes in respiration, where consistently higher soil temperatures, as well as less drying than is observed in the mid latitudes (Figs

However our 50%-100% simulations present the same response as our high and mid latitude results, where local soil carbon increases. This highlights the importance of the initial magnitude of land use change, and resultant climate change, on the soil carbon response to deforestation in the UVic ESCM. The 15%-75% simulations all have converging levels of forest loss by 2100 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g003" href="#pone.0153357.g003">Fig 3</a>), thus the rate of change of land cover can also play a role in soil carbon retention. This further enhances the argument that the change in soil carbon arises through a multitude of pathways, which influence the influx and outflux of carbon.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increase in atmospheric CO
