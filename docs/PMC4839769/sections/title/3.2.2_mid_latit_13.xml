 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean global SAT anomalies, while statistically significant by year 2100 (
  <a rid="pone.0153357.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0153357.t001">Table 1</a>), are small and straddle zero K. At the end of the century the general tendency is cooling in the lower deforestation fraction with slight warming in the 15% and 25% scenarios. The larger input of CO
  <sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere results in initial warming for deforestation of and above 45% (see Carbon Cycle section below). By mid-century albedo effects overcome the initial increase in greenhouse gas concentration and at the end of the simulation these scenarios exhibit very small SAT change or some cooling (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g007" href="#pone.0153357.g007">Fig 7</a>). The increase in local albedo dominates the temperature response over deforested areas which remain colder than the control even during periods where higher atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> cause mean global positive SAT anomalies (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The globally averaged time series of soil temperature response shows a similar pattern to the SATs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g008" href="#pone.0153357.g008">Fig 8</a>). In all simulations, average local soil temperatures over deforested bins are warmer than those of the control, with cooling occurring outside of the deforested areas (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g008" href="#pone.0153357.g008">Fig 8</a>). The initial local soil temperature response is proportional to the amount of deforestation. In most cases positive anomalies continue to increase, the exceptions being the 75% and 100% simulations which, due to reduced rates of energy absorption, resulting from increased albedo and outgoing latent heat flux, have a decreasing trend following deforestation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all scenarios, deforestation leads to mean drying over land, with the decrease in moisture driven predominately by change over deforested bins (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g009" href="#pone.0153357.g009">Fig 9</a>). Drying over deforested areas tends to be proportional to the deforestation fraction, the exception being the 100% simulation which, although drier than the control, has slightly higher P-E values than the 75% scenario.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean ET and precipitation both increase over deforested areas, however in all simulations ET increases more than precipitation. Differing from the mean response, conditions are wetter in a significant number of deforested bins over Eastern Asia (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g009" href="#pone.0153357.g009">Fig 9</a>). While precipitation does increase, the positive P-E anomaly over these deforested bins is caused by a decrease in ET. The change in soil temperature over deforested areas in Eastern Asia also tends to be different from that of other areas. While the general response is warming, the temperature increase tends to be smaller and many bins in the area show cooler soil conditions after deforestation (
