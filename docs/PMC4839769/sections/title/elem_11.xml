 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The modeled temperature and carbon cycle responses to deforestation are intrinsically linked, complicating our choice of what to present and discuss first. Some readers might wish to come back to the temperature findings after reading the carbon cycle results (Section 3.3).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For all simulations deforestation causes a reduction in global SAT, with the cooling being proportional to deforested percentage (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g004" href="#pone.0153357.g004">Fig 4</a>). The reduction in temperature is magnified at higher latitudes due to an increase in snow and ice cover and consequent increase in albedo. In the 100% scenario the average temperature change from 20°N to 40°N was -0.42K and the temperature change from 40°N and above was -0.78K. Lower atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> values are also responsible for some of the larger cooling seen in the 45% and 100% deforestation simulations (see Section 4). Deforestation also causes a decrease in global and local soil temperature (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g005" href="#pone.0153357.g005">Fig 5</a>—The term local refers to area weighted averages over the initially deforested grid cells), however soil temperatures become warmer in areas with large forest cover prior to deforestation (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g001" href="#pone.0153357.g001">Fig 1</a>). This warming is due to, similarly to what is observed more commonly in the mid- and low-latitude experiments, a decrease in sensible heat flux following deforestation. Soil temperatures show a similar trend to the SAT response

The magnitude and rate of initial warming tends to be proportional to the deforested area fraction and higher deforestation fractions tend to reach their peak positive anomaly sooner. Similar to the mid-latitude experiments, albedo effects start to overcome the initial CO

   <sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere seen in this experiment (see Carbon Cycle results below). SAT change over deforested bins is eventually dominated by the local increase in albedo and differs significantly from what is seen globally. At the end of the simulation all scenarions show negative local anomalies. As in the global case, the relative importance of albedo effects tend to be increase with deforested area (

Our simulations indicate that contrary to the areas that become wetter in the mid latitudes simulations, the positive P-E anomalies in the low latitude deforested bins are caused by an increase in precipitation and not decreased ET.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared to the mid latitudes, where the wetter conditions occur in areas of mixed warming and cooling soil temperatures, low latitude bins with positive P-E show no significant variation in soil temperature (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g012" href="#pone.0153357.g012">Fig 12</a> (bottom) it can be seen that there is an increase in P-E outside the deforested areas. This increase is not exclusive to the 100% deforestation shown, being seen in all scenarios. It is this increase in moisture in non-deforested areas, as well as the less pronounced decrease in moisture in the deforested areas for the 5%-45% simulations, that leads to an average global increase of moisture over land at various times in the simulations for the 15%-45% scenarios.
