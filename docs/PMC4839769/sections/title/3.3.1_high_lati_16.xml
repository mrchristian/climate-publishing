 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All deforestation simulations show an initial increase in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> relative to the control. The increase is proportional to deforested area and ranges from 3 to 50 ppmv (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g013" href="#pone.0153357.g013">Fig 13</a>, top). This expected increase in CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration is due to the release of carbon stored in the forests [

  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref045">45</a>]. Although the relative difference between the simulations and the control decreases in the first 10 years after deforestation, atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> values for the 15% and 25% deforestation experiments remain above those of the control during the whole simulation due to continued, competition algorithm induced, loss of forests leading to increased CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions. For the 45%-100% deforestation experiments however, the post-deforestation pulse reduction in CO
  <sub>2</sub> is such that from about year 2040 onward these scenarios’ atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations are lower than those of the control (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Atmospheric carbon closely mirrors the changes to land carbon—the sum of soil and vegetation carbon. CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels are higher in experiments where deforestation leads to net loss of carbon by the land reservoir and lower in simulations where the removal of trees cause an increase in land carbon stocks (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>). Deforestation always results in an decrease in vegetation carbon and an increase in the soil carbon pool. Some of this increase takes place over non-deforested areas where, for high- mid- and low-latitude deforestation, NPP increases due to changes in climate and the CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect. The net change in the land carbon pool, and consequently the atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> response, is determined by the relative magnitude of these soil and vegetation carbon changes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ignoring the small drawdowns of the 5% experiment, deforestation of up to 25% results in losses in the land carbon pool and increase in atmospheric carbon (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>). For the 45%-100% deforestation scenarios the increase in soil carbon overcomes the losses from vegetation carbon. In these simulations the land gains carbon at the expense of the atmosphere, where CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations decrease (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increase in soil carbon is related to a reduction in soil heterotrophic respiration due to colder and drier conditions and also to an increase in modelled net primary productivity (NPP) over deforested areas (not shown and caused by the higher modeled NPP of grasslands compared to forests in these latitudes). In the 5%-25% simulations the increase in soil carbon was larger in the non-deforested areas than in the deforested areas. We interpret this as an indication that climate played a larger role than alterations in NPP due to land cover change in the increase of soil carbon in these experiments. Deforested areas contribute to approximately 58%-70% of the increase in soil carbon in the 45%-100% deforestation scenarios, showing that in these experiments the higher NPP of croplands also played a role in accumulation of land carbon. Although croplands are usually associated with reductions in NPP, observations have found an increase in NPP after forest loss in high latitudes [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref046">46</a>], and modeling efforts have found an increase due to higher grassland productivity and CO
  <sub>2</sub>-fertilization despite colder temperatures [
