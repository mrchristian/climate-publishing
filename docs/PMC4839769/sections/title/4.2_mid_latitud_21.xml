 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SAT cooling seen in the 100% mid latitude deforestation scenario is in general agreement with previous studies [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref025">25</a>], albeit the 0.077 K reduction in temperature at 2100 recorded by our experiments is larger than the 0.04 K cooling produced by comparable simulations [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. Our experiments generated albedo increases of 1% to 5%, within the range range of earlier efforts that found increases of 4.7% to 5% [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By 2100 the 75% scenario has near identical forest loss as the 25% and 45%. However, the 75% and 100% experiments show higher initial albedo increase, as well as reduced atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> through increased soil carbon, driving further global cooling. The rapid increase in albedo in the 75% and 100% scenarios effect the soil temperatures as well, which decrease over the first 60 years, before the temperature anomalies begin to trend upwards again. This points to the importance of the magnitude of the initial disturbance on modelled climates. Although the 25%-75% scenarios all reach similar forest loss by 2100, and display converging albedo values, the larger initial land use change results in higher initial albedo values which allow the 45%-75% simulations to reach lower temperatures despite having final land use change fractions similar to the 25% simulations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the mid latitudes, the local response to deforestation differs compared to the high latitudes. The increase in ET leads to more drying than what is observed in the high latitudes (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g006" href="#pone.0153357.g006">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g009" href="#pone.0153357.g009">9</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g015" href="#pone.0153357.g015">15</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g016" href="#pone.0153357.g016">16</a>). This is also accompanied by increased soil temperatures in the mid latitude deforested bins, opposed to the local response to high latitude deforestation (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g005" href="#pone.0153357.g005">5</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g008" href="#pone.0153357.g008">8</a>). Soil temperatures increase, despite the added cooling from increased modelled outgoing latent heat and albedo, primarily due to the decreased roughness length following deforestation. Decreased roughness lengths lead to less outgoing sensible heat, which becomes the dominant driver in local soil temperatures for these experiments. Following deforestation the outgoing sensible heat flux (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g016" href="#pone.0153357.g016">Fig 16</a>) decreases more than at the high latitudes, resulting in a higher retention of heat in the soils, and thus higher soil temperatures.

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The accumulation of global soil carbon is driven by the increase in NPP and a decrease in soil respiration. The change in soil carbon accumulation is intrinsically tied to the change in soil temperature and moisture. Globally, all deforestation fractions led to drier conditions over land, and global soil temperatures tend to decrease, the exception being the 15% and 25% scenarios (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g009" href="#pone.0153357.g009">9</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g008" href="#pone.0153357.g008">8</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The opposing effects of warming and drying trends determines the exchange of carbon between soil and atmosphere. The 15% and 25% scenarios experience the largest local warming, however do not experience the same level of drying as is seen in the 45%-100% scenarios. The 45%-100% scenarios also experience less warming then the 15% and 25% scenarios, leading to reduced respiration in the 45%-100% cases and larger drawdown of atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub>. This results in larger soil carbon quantities and less atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g013" href="#pone.0153357.g013">13</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">14</a>). The increase in CO
  <sub>2</sub> seen in the 5%-25% simulations is linked to the less rapid loss of forests than was seen in the 45%-100% scenarios, resulting in less albedo cooling, and a slower release of CO
  <sub>2</sub> over time. The warmer global soil temperatures of the 15% and 25% scenarios are due to the higher surface air temperatures, where increased CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations, as well as lower surface albedos than the 45%-100% scenarios, highlighting the complex interactions which take place in determining local and global temperatures.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to the high latitudes, some mid latitude deforestation simulations differed from observational studies where deforestation led to a decrease in soil carbon due to increased respiration [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref048">48</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref052">52</a>]. In our experiments the 45%-100% simulations resulted in local soil carbon increase, which is in agreement with observations that indicate that the conversion of grassland to forest causes a soil carbon reduction [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref049">49</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The response to deforestation in the mid latitudes shows the transition between high and low latitude deforestation where albedo change becomes a less dominant driver of temperature and changes to CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations and the sensible heat flux play a larger role in local and global temperature response. The high latitudes experience cooling in every simulation almost instantaneously (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g004" href="#pone.0153357.g004">Fig 4</a>), whereas the presence of higher CO
  <sub>2</sub>, and decreased outgoing sensible heat flux overcome the albedo change and increased latent heat, resulting in longer lasting warmer conditions in the mid latitudes (
