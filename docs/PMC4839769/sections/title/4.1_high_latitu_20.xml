 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lower temperatures observed in our 5%-25% deforestation experiments are in agreement with previous modelling studies where the albedo effect outweighs the increase in CO
  <sub>2</sub> for high latitude deforestation [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref022">22</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>]. Differently from these earlier results, our cooling is magnified in the 45%-100% scenarios by a decrease in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> caused largely by an accumulation of soil carbon over deforested areas. By 2100 our 100% simulation produced cooling of approximately 0.4 K, with an average cooling over the duration of the simulation of 0.33 K. The average cooling is similar to what was found by previous experiments where a cooling of 0.25 K is observed [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>], but at 2100 we obtained cooling that was only about half of what is modeled by other simulations [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. In terms of albedo, we detected high-latitude increases ranging from 2.02% to 12.74% by 2100, with larger deforestation events producing higher increases in albedo. This is higher than the 10.7% increase of high latitude albedo at 2100 obtained by earlier efforts [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. When global albedo is considered, our average increases of 0.01 to 0.04 are smaller than what was observed by other experiments that reported a global average increase of 0.07 [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>]. It is likely that the discrepancies between our results and these past efforts are at least partly due to differences in the selection of the latitudinal ranges used by the different experiments [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Earlier simulations of complete deforestation in areas above 45°N caused an increase in soil carbon over deforested areas [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>], but in these experiments the extra soil carbon was not enough to compensate for the loss of biomass and litter carbon, leading to an overall loss of land carbon and a ≤ 5 ppm increase in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>]. Another set of previous experiments, while not reporting changes in soil carbon, find a similar (5 ppm at 2100) increase in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> in their 100% high latitude deforestation simulations [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. It must be noted that one of these experiments did not account for anthropogenic emissions [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>], which are considered by the other [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a managed forest, clear cutting has been shown to reduce soil carbon [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref048">48</a>]. At particular temperate zone sites conversion of forests to cropland resulted in about a 32% ±20% decrease in soil carbon and the conversion of grassland to forest caused soil carbon 
  <span class="italic">reduction</span> of about 7%± 23% [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref049">49</a>]. Even our low-end deforestation scenarios result in land cover change at much larger spatial scale than those analyzed by these observational studies [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref048">48</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref049">49</a>] and comparison with our results should be made with caution.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The initial surface air and soil cooling of the 45%-100% experiments are markedly larger (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g004" href="#pone.0153357.g004">4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g005" href="#pone.0153357.g005">5</a>) than those of the other simulations. It is this rapid albedo-related cooling, and the associated slow down of soil respiration, which lead to the larger retention of carbon over land in these scenarios. As the surface albedo and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> begin to change, they influence the surface energy balance, which in turn effects the soil temperatures. In the case of the high latitudes, the resultant magnitude of the changes to the energy balance that lead to the decrease in soil temperatures.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Removal of trees shortens the roughness length and causes a reduction in outgoing sensible heat flux, a warming effect, over deforested bins. At the same time, deforested areas—due to an increase in modeled evaporation—experience increases in the outgoing latent heat flux and a decrease in shortwave absorption. The final result is a reduction in net incoming energy and soil cooling (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g015" href="#pone.0153357.g015">Fig 15</a>). In a similar way, high-latitude deforestation has been observed to cause local cooling despite a decreased outgoing sensible heat flux [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reduction in soil moisture, while less important in explaining the initial accumulation of soil carbon, is likely exerting a larger influence after about 2060, when soil carbon continues to increase (albeit at slower rates) in spite of increasing soil temperature over deforested areas (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g005" href="#pone.0153357.g005">5</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">14</a>). In 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g006" href="#pone.0153357.g006">Fig 6</a>, an interesting result is shown where the drying in the 100% simulation isn’t the largest, compared to the temperature and carbon response, where the 100% scenario produces the most extreme changes. The increased moisture is likely due to the larger area used for 100% deforestation, with more snow covered areas and more cooling resulting in less ET. This result can also be observed in (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g015" href="#pone.0153357.g015">Fig 15</a>) where the latent heat flux of the 100% simulation is less than the 45% and 50% scenarios for the majority of the simulation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidently, we don’t make the claim that our findings justify large scale high latitude deforestation as a means of carbon sequestration. Nevertheless, our results point to the complex interaction between soil carbon dynamics and climate and the significant role this interaction plays on the modelled climatic response to land cover change.</p>
