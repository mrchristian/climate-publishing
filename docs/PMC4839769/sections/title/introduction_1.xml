 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agricultural lands occupy approximately 38% of the Earth’s land surface [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref001">1</a>]. These croplands and pastures presently cover about 10%, 45% and 27% of the areas originally occupied by boreal, temperate, and tropical forests respectively [

  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref004">4</a>]. Population growth and the associated expansion of agricultural lands is the primary cause of present day deforestation [

  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref005">5</a>]. Although rates of deforestation have decreased over the last decade, the loss of forested areas is expected to continue during the present century [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While most deforestation occurs in the tropics, non-tropical forests are likely to suffer new deforestation pressures as the climate warms and areas which were previously too cold become suitable for agriculture [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref009">9</a>,

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assuming recent rates of human population growth are maintained until the end of the century, the Earth’s population will approach 10 billion around 2100. With current population to agriculture density of ∼ 147 people per km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, to meet the same quantity of food availability as present day, with no increases in productivity through technological advances, by 2100 agricultural areas would have to be increased by 43% [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref001">1</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Deforestation can impact climate on local and global scales by changes in the energy, mass and momentum fluxes between climate subsystems energy reservoirs. Deforestation is also associated with CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions, as crops and marginal lands that usually replace trees after land clearing tend to hold less carbon per unit area than forests [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. The radiative forcing associated with an increase in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> is, from a climatic perspective, the most important biogeochemical impact of deforestation. Increases in CO
  <sub>2</sub> also have the potential to affect climate by altering transpiration rates, due to CO
  <sub>2</sub> increased water use efficiency reducing stomatal conductance and increasing plant growth [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref013">13</a>–

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The biogeophysical impacts of deforestation most pertinent to climate are changes to surface albedo, evapotranspiration (ET) and surface roughness length [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref016">16</a>]. Croplands and pastures tend to have higher albedo than forests, which causes them to absorb a smaller fraction of the incoming solar radiation. Trees tend to have deeper rooting depth than crops and grasses such that tree removal implies a decreased ET and associated reduction in latent heat flux [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref014">14</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref017">17</a>], ET can also be reduced through the reduction in canopy capture following deforestation, as well as from reduced turbulence associated with a lower aerodynamic roughness length and colder temperatures. For large-scale land cover change the alterations in ET could influence cloud formation potentially impacting atmospheric albedo and atmospheric longwave absorption [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In previous modelling efforts, the net temperature response to deforestation, to a large extent, is determined by the magnitudes of these opposing warming (higher atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> and lower latent heat flux) and cooling (increased albedo) effects (for some examples: [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref018">18</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref021">21</a>]). The albedo-related cooling is particularly important at mid to high latitudes, where the presence of snow exacerbates the differences in reflectivity between forests and fields [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>], while the warming due to decreases in latent heat flux has a greater impact at low latitudes where the absolute changes in ET are larger [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref022">22</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref023">23</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most modelling studies so far have analyzed the response to large-scale land cover change. In some, deforestation was global or performed over whole latitude bands [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref018">18</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref020">20</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref025">25</a>] while others simulated global historical anthropogenic deforestation [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref021">21</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref026">26</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref027">27</a>]. In general terms, these past simulations show that the temperature response of high latitude deforestation is still dominated by the albedo effect, resulting in a cooler climate. That is, while deforestation causes atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations to increase, the increment in albedo is enough to counteract greenhouse gas warming and yield a reduced surface air temperature (SAT). This cooling is global, and centered over the deforested areas [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref022">22</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>]. Global temperature changes associated with mid latitude deforestation follow the same trend as for the high latitudes but with temperature changes of smaller magnitude [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. Contrary to the cooling seen in the mid and high latitudes, simulated low latitude deforestation yields a warmer climate, with the increase in temperature attributed to the reduction in ET, and increased atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub>, which dominates the temperature signal [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref025">25</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref028">28</a>]. Some studies have noted that a reduction in cloud cover, and hence, reduced atmospheric albedo over deforested regions was an important contributor to the modelled warming [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. There have been indications from satellite based observations [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref029">29</a>] and modeling [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref023">23</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref030">30</a>] efforts that the temperature response is dependent on the scale and location of land cover change. According to these studies, in many high latitude and mid latitude areas deforestation would result not in cooling but in net warming or no significant change as the CO
  <sub>2</sub> and ET induced energy gain overtakes the albedo induced losses.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we use a global climate model of intermediate complexity, with a coupled carbon cycle model, to determine to what degree the scale of deforestation may influence the climate system’s response to high, mid and low latitude deforestation. This is done by a series of experiments, where deforestation fractions range from 5%-100% of the tree covered area over these distinct latitude bands. The simulations are conducted from 2011 to 2100 with CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions based on the IPCC A2 scenario [
