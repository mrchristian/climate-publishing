 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The initial air surface warming which occurs due to low latitude deforestation is in agreement with earlier studies [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref053">53</a>]. The magnitude of the temperature change is not consistent with previous studies due to differences in the location and magnitude of deforested areas and CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations. Our 100% simulation resulted in a 0.04 K global warming by 2100 while previous studies show values ranging from 0.4 K [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>] to 0.7 K [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our 3% to 10.8% albedo increase was larger than the 4.1% recorded for some experiments [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>] while our average albedo increase of 0.01 to 0.02 was smaller than the increase of 0.04 seen in other simulations [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>]. The local cooling observed in our study is seen, although not to the same extent, in some [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref022">22</a>] but not all [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>] comparable experiments.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference between these studies is likely due to the different carbon and albedo responses, as well as some of the inherent differences in the models used. By 2100 our 100% scenario had an increased CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration of ∼ 66.5 ppm, while comparable experiments resulted in an increase of 199 ppm [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>]. Another difference is that previous studies [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>] produced a reduction in ET, as well as a decreased atmospheric albedo from reduced cloud cover, both of which contribute to increased temperatures.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite based studies show that that depending upon the scale of deforestation, cloud cover may not change and may even increase over disturbed areas [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref029">29</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref036">36</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref037">37</a>]. This contradicts the above mentioned results [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>] and may lead to added cooling not accounted for in these modelling studies. One of these previous efforts [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref012">12</a>] found that the net albedo change over the deforested regions was negligible as the increase in surface albedo was compensated by the decrease in atmospheric albedo, and suggests that cloud cover may play a major role in tropical climates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clouds cover is prescribed in the UVic ESCM and in our experiments the post-deforestation surface albedo increase is not compensated by a decrease in atmospheric albedo due to a reduction in cloud cover over deforested areas. This helps explains the local cooling registered by our simulations and lends support to the argument that a reduction in cloud cover is an important component of the modelled temperature response to deforestation in the tropics see in previous experiments.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Low latitude deforestation has been associated with a decrease in modelled total land carbon [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>], and the same occurs in all of our simulations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" href="#pone.0153357.g014">Fig 14</a>). The same authors [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref024">24</a>] also see a reduction in soil carbon in the deforested areas, and increases in the non-deforested areas, which is observed in our 5%-45% scenarios, but is in disagreement with our 50%-100% experiments where we record an increase in soil carbon in all locations, regardless of land cover change. Soil temperatures were larger in the low latitudes, and conditions were wetter than the mid latitudes. It is likely this difference in climate that causes the larger reduction in local soil carbon, in the 5%-45% scenarios than the mid latitude cases. During the simulations the 5%-25% scenarios become wetter, relative to their initial drying following deforestation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g012" href="#pone.0153357.g012">Fig 12</a>). This change in behaviour, as well as warmer soil temperatures (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g011" href="#pone.0153357.g011">Fig 11</a>), can account for the increased respiration relative to carbon drawdown, and hence the decreased local soil carbon in these experiments.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local soil warming occurs due to the same energy balance modifications seen in the mid latitudes, with higher temperatures related to a decrease in outgoing sensible heat flux that overcomes the increase in outgoing net radiative and latent heat fluxes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g017" href="#pone.0153357.g017">Fig 17</a>). The higher local soil temperature anomalies present in the low latitudes, occur due to the larger reductions in outgoing sensible heat, as well as increased rates of change in the energy budget of the soils, than what is seen in the mid latitudes (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g016" href="#pone.0153357.g016">16</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g017" href="#pone.0153357.g017">17</a>). The increase in outgoing latent heat flux and reduction in sensible heat flux, also explains the lower SATs over deforested areas in the low latitudes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g010" href="#pone.0153357.g010">Fig 10</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The direction of the soil carbon response of our 5- 45% low latitude simulations are in agreement with some observations [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref048">48</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref052">52</a>] but differ from what has been described by other [
  <a rid="pone.0153357.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153357.ref049">49</a>]. Although NPP increases due to the forest-to-cropland conversion, this is not enough to overcome the changes in respiration, where consistently higher soil temperatures, as well as less drying than is observed in the mid latitudes (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g008" href="#pone.0153357.g008">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g011" href="#pone.0153357.g011">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g009" href="#pone.0153357.g009">9</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g012" href="#pone.0153357.g012">12</a>), lead to a larger reduction in local soil carbon. However our 50%-100% simulations present the same response as our high and mid latitude results, where local soil carbon increases. This highlights the importance of the initial magnitude of land use change, and resultant climate change, on the soil carbon response to deforestation in the UVic ESCM. The 15%-75% simulations all have converging levels of forest loss by 2100 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g003" href="#pone.0153357.g003">Fig 3</a>), thus the rate of change of land cover can also play a role in soil carbon retention. This further enhances the argument that the change in soil carbon arises through a multitude of pathways, which influence the influx and outflux of carbon.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increase in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub>, and warmer temperatures seen in our low latitude simulations, are climatic effects more often associated with modelled deforestation. Even then, due mostly to the soil carbon response, CO
  <sub>2</sub> and temperature increases are not proportional to deforested area. Seeing as how the location and scale of deforestation can lead to either an increase or decrease to local and global soil carbon, our results call attention to the subtleties of this response and toward a need for a better understanding the complexity of soil carbon dynamics [
