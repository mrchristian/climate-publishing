 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global Change Model (GCM) (IPCC, 2007) was used in this study to generate climate change scenarios. An empirical downscaling procedure was applied, due to the coarse resolution of GCM climate data, in order to reproduce the future European climate at a regional scale using a weather simulator (LARS WG

The results of Hardley Centre coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3 GCM) for A2 scenario (time slices were centred over the 2030–2059 and 2070–2099 time periods, for +2 °C and +5 °C,respectively) were used to derive the forcing factors to be used in the downscaling procedure. Following the approach proposed by Moriondo,

These were computed for 304 selected GCM (Global Circulation Model) grid points over the domain, as monthly average differences of Tmin, Tmax, rainfall and solar radiation between the future and the reference period. Then, forcing factors calculated for each GCM grid were applied in the downscaling procedure to perturb the relevant climatology of the observed dataset generating stochastically 100 years of daily data for each 50 × 50 km grid point corresponding to an average increase of +2 °C (Scenario +2 °C) and +5 °C (Scenario +5°).
