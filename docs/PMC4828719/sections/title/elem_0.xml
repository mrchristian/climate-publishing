  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AFLA-maize, a mechanistic model, was applied to predict 
   <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> growth and aflatoxin production in maize, using weather data as input
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>. AFLA-maize was also linked to a crop phenology prediction module, based on temperature sums, with a focus on the crucial stages of flowering and ripening, or date of harvest. Two climate change scenarios, +2 °C and +5 °C above pre-industrial levels, which take into account whether or not mitigation strategies for climate change are applied, in addition to the present (baseline) scenario, were considered.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each scenario, 100 years of simulated daily weather data (minimum and maximum temperatures, rainfall and solar radiation) were obtained for each of the 2254 georeferenced (central) grid points, with grids spaced 50 × 50 km, over the European domain. These data were used as input for running both the crop phenology model and the AFLA-maize model. Output of the crop phenology model, i.e. predicted flowering and harvest dates, was also used as input for AFLA-maize. The final output included aflatoxin hazard indexes (AFI) for each of the mentioned grid point (2254 points) throughout Europe, per simulation run (100 years) and scenario (present, + 2 °C and +5 °C climate change scenarios ; see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">supplementary material for details</a>). AFI = 0 when the host crop: i) cannot be grown in the grid point due to unsuitable meteorological conditions, or ii) its susceptibility to 
   <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> never occur or never match. When AFI &gt; 0, fungus-host interactions are possible as well as the production of aflatoxins. Referring to the current legal limits in Europe (Commission Regulations 574/2011 and 1881/2006 with amendments), the threshold of 5 μg of aflatoxin per kg of raw maize kernels was considered consistent with AFI ≥ 95.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data on 
   <span class="italic">A. flavus</span>-wheat interactions and predictive models were not available from the literature. Therefore, AFLA-wheat, a modified version of the AFLA-maize model, was developed and run using the same meteorological input data as with the AFLA-maize model (See 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">supplementary material</a> for details). An AFI threshold for high probability of wheat contamination was not available, due to the lack of data on grain contamination. Therefore, an AFI ≥ 38 was considered to coincide with the legal limit for aflatoxin B
   <sub>1</sub> in wheat of 2 μg of aflatoxin per kg of raw grains (Commission Regulation 1881/ 2006 and amendments).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model output, i.e., the AFI computed for maize and wheat, was summarised representing the 2254 grid points in Europe, 100 simulated years, and the three scenarios (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present scenario, for maize, mean AFI computed over all sites was 38, the percentage of sites with mean AFI &gt; 0 was 39%, but only in 20% of the sites mean AF contamination was predicted to be above the current legal limit in Europe (AFI &gt; 95). In the +2 °C and the +5 °C scenarios, mean AFI (over all sites) was 73 and 95, respectively. Mean AFI increased by 92% and 149% when moving from the present scenario to the +2 °C and +5 °C scenarios, respectively, and 39% and 54% of the sites with AFI &gt; 95.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maps were drawn using geo-referenced grid points to highlight the predicted future aflatoxin contamination in Europe based on predicted AFI (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). In the present scenario, the area with possible aflatoxin production in maize (AFI &gt; 0) is mainly below the 45° North latitude, because of the limiting conditions for 
   <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> growth and aflatoxin production at higher latitudes. Increasing temperature clearly enlarges the area of interest for maize. In the +5 °C scenario, maize farming is predicted in latitudes as high as 60° North, a much more northern geographic distribution than the current maize growing area. In both climate change scenarios, the most concerned areas with an increase of aflatoxin contamination were: Eastern Europe, Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean regions. However, the highest mean AFI values were found under the +2 °C scenario, frequently in the range of 160–200. Aflatoxin contamination above the legal limit are expected to become more frequent in the future, based on our results. This prediction is further confirmed by results shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>, presenting the minimum and maximum probabilities of aflatoxin contamination in the 100 simulated years in the +2 °C scenario. The south of Europe has a high chance of becoming a risk area for aflatoxin contamination in maize, even in the least conducive year (i.e. with the lowest AFI value). Under the +2 °C scenario, the growing area of maize is expected to be almost the same as in the present scenario and an advance in flowering and harvesting dates is limited to 5 and 10 days, respectively (See 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">supplementary material</a> for details). Therefore, in this context, the agricultural management practices are not expected to change significantly, which makes predictions, obtained using only weather data as input, even more robust. The reliability of results is further supported by the confirmed accuracy of model predictions, irrespective of extreme weather conditions, and its sensitivity to data input, especially temperature.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding wheat, in the present scenario, mean AFI was 0.7. According to the model predictions, over 90% of the sites may allow 
   <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> growth (AFI &gt; 0), although with very low AFI values. Mean AFI increased by 60% and more than doubled in the +2 °C and +5 °C scenarios, respectively (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>), but the probability of aflatoxin contamination in wheat is so low that it can be considered irrelevant.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When AFI &gt; 5 is considered, only 1% of the sites have a contamination above this threshold in the present scenario, increased to 3.5% and 4.4% in the +2 °C and +5 °C scenarios, respectively (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Figs 3</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">4</a>). For all three scenarios, an increase in the mean AFI was found in several areas, but mainly in central Italy, Eastern Europe and close to the Baltic Sea, always with low probabilities of contamination. This confirms findings reported so far

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering variation between years, the lowest and the highest means of AFI computed for maize are, respectively, 0.5 and 0.9 for the present scenario, 0.83 and 1.49 for the +2 °C scenario, and 1.03 and 2.06 for the +5 °C scenario. Therefore, a decrease of around 20% and an increase of around 34% with respect to the means were determined in the least and most conducive year, respectively. The variation between years is comparable in the +2 °C scenario, with −22% and +38%, and in the +5 °C scenario (−28% and +43%).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on this modelling approach to predict future aflatoxin contamination in maize grown in Europe, the +2 °C climate change scenario
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>, currently considered the most reliable for the next 100 years
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>, resulted into a significant increase in the estimated aflatoxin contamination in all maize growing areas, whereas the predicted impact on contamination in wheat was negligible.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Impact on European countries</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the current climatic conditions, European countries in which maize cultivation is common, i.e. in Romania, France, Hungary and north-east Italy (in total accounting for 60% of the total production in 2013 for the 28 EU Member States, FAOStat, 2013), show a low probability of aflatoxin occurrence. An increase from a low to a medium probability of aflatoxin contamination is found under the +2 °C scenario. Critical and high AFI are predicted in some areas of southern European countries (i.e. in Greece, southern Italy, Bulgaria and Albania), in which maize production is marginal, but important for the local population. The +5 °C scenario leads to a larger European domain exposed to aflatoxin contamination. However, despite these figures, an increase in AFI in southern Europe is of limited concern since conditions are less suitable for 
   <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> growth. Northern European countries are currently in the safe zone regarding aflatoxin contamination, but they may face new climatic conditions leading to a new agro-socio-economic context.
