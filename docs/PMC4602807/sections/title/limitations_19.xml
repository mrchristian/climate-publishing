 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Google Map provides a function of route-planning for optimal path suggestion by artificial intelligence, but sometimes the real situations of roads for ambulancesâ€™ progress are unpredictable, especially if extreme weather conditions occur. In fact, the judgment of the driver in decisions such as the road re-routing, the deceleration, the acceleration, or even the halt is very important in a calamitous transportation. Hence, the estimation of time and distance in this study will leave an uncertain erroneousness.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, this project tries to formulate a hypothesis to accumulate the time needed for each transportation. Although in an ideal scenario, the transfer units tend to correspond to the casualties, in real life, this probability is extremely low because the ambulances are limited in units.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another limitation is the MEMC selection. Some potential locations have been designed in advance for such purposes, but they may not be suitable for sufficient operations in a realistic situation of an extreme weather condition. In other words, a theoretical TE or DE can be found by calculation and by using an expected MEMC, but in real-life conditions, the value of TE or DE can be relatively lower.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time used in an MEMC for the first-aid treatment before transferring to hospitals is eliminated; however, this will create an error in time comparison between the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method when the retention time in an MEMC is long.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EMS ground transportation is the major scheme for prehospital transferral in Taiwan. Nevertheless, some other disaster response actions may be operated, such as the aerotransportation when the roads are destroyed by weather phenomena such as the heavy rainfall, landslides, earthquakes, and other similar incidents. The concept of the sequential-conveyance method will not be affected by different EMS transportation vehicles because the MEMC will be treated as a relay station for ground and aerotransportation and the computation manners will be changed.</p>
