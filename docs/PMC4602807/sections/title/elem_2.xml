   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The definition of ambulances is general and it refers to both urgent and nonurgent ambulances. All types of ambulances are acceptable, but some calibrations of time used may be performed for certain types of ambulances.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Taiwan, hospitals are basically classified into 3 different levels: the local community hospitals, the metropolitan hospitals, and the academic medical centers, depending on the evaluation of the quality and the quantity of the medical care. Typically, the services of the high-level hospitals are mostly related to serious health incidents, whereas low-level hospitals are for minor and nonurgent incidents. For this study, the EMS transportation for the local community hospitals is referred as first-line (1st-L H), for the metropolitan hospitals as second-line (2nd-L H), and for the academic medical centers as third-line hospitals (3rd-L H).</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What is proposed as a MEMC is a surge refuge, which is hybridized with a disaster-medical-aid center. The MEMCs have many differences compared with the traditional disaster-medical-aid centers or the casualty-collection points.

    </span> To evacuate the area of an MCI, all the survivors, including the casualties, will be transferred to MEMCs, so that the required emergency medical treatment for injuries will be given. These MEMCs are the only intermediate facilities from the disaster area to the hospitals. Fully equipped trailers with medical personnel and necessities reach a specific location that must be safe and wide. Meanwhile, armamentaria and manpower are ready for patient care. Physicians in a MEMC can do further professional triage and assign transferrals of the second-line ambulances to the requested hospitals. This analysis mostly focuses on the aspects of the emergency transportation in MEMCs.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this EMS transportation, ambulances are categorized into 2 different lines. The first-line ambulances (1st-L ABL) transfer patients between the disaster area and a MEMC reciprocately. The benefits of this class are the saving of time and shortening of working distances. The second-line ambulances (2nd-L ABL) transfer patients between a MEMC and the requested hospitals, an action that directly transports heavily injured patients to specific hospitals only under the guidance of the physicians. A comparison between the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method is depicted in Figure

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On August 8, 2009, Typhoon Morakot wrought havoc in Taiwan, by taking the lives of 702 individuals and by causing damage of roughly US$ 6.76 billion.
   <span class="sup">
    <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">25</a>
   </span> Almost all the southern regions of Taiwan were flooded by a record-breaking heavy rain that caused damages beyond any imagination. This tragedy is also known as the “88 Wind-caused Disasters.”
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The project concentrates on Xiaolin mountain village, which was heavily destroyed by a devastating mudslide during the Typhoon Morakot. It is believed that &gt;400 residents buried alive, whereas 137 people were saved and sent to safety areas; 16 of them with injuries were transported to hospitals for further medical care.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Scenario Setting</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two versions of casualty transportation are compared: the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method. Both are shown in Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>. In Panel A, the conventional method imitates the real scene of EMS transportation in Xiaolin village; whereas Panel B represents a virtual scenario of the sequential-conveyance method. In the conventional method, all casualties are sent to different lines of hospitals and as a result, anomalies of poor regulation and cross-communication may occur. This allows further diversions among hospitals (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>: Panel A; dashed lines), which are performed frequently, and they are based on matters such as the emergency department (ED) crowding, the poor prehospital triage, and other problems similar to these.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reason why Xiaolin village was selected for this study is its arduous casualty transportation. Jiasion elementary school, a safe and open space near the area of Xiaolin village, is chosen as an MEMC in the sequential-conveyance method. According to the records, all the casualties were transferred to 4 hospitals that can be classified into 3 lines. Chishan and Sijhou Hospital (denoted as 1st-L H), Tainan Municipal Hospital (denoted as 2nd-L H) and Chi Mei Medical Center (denoted as 3rd-L H) are assigned as first-line, second-line, and third-line hospital(s), respectively.</p>

   <span class="sup">
    <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">26</a>
   </span> 137 people were found alive and rescued from the calamity-stricken village of Xiaolin during the Typhon Morakot; 16 of them were injured and sent to hospitals for further treatment. The original raw data of referrals are shown in Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>. For the sequential-conveyance method, it is assumed that all the 135 people (the destination of 2 cases has not been registered) were sent to an MEMC and 16 of them were later sent to different lines of hospitals for further treatment. Two major different flow ratios are presented, one of the survivors who were transferred to hospitals and one of the survivors who were transferred to refuges (or a MEMC), to discriminate the patient flow and nonpatient flow between the 2 scenarios of conventional and sequential-conveyance methods. It is worth mentioning that an MEMC is a chimera of a refuge and a disaster-medical-aid center; therefore, all survivors were first sent to an MEMC and some of them were later transferred to hospitals for intensive care.

In the case of Xiaolin, only 16 of 135 casualties in the MEMC were transferred to the different lines of hospitals, after assuming that the residuals were stabilized and readily treated in the MEMC. For a theoretical comparison between the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method, all assumptions are depicted in Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>. In Panel A, the survival flows in the conventional method are represented as survivals (p + q; p, nonpatients; q, patients) in the Xiaolin (X) event are sent to different destinations chaotically. Nonpatients are sent to refuges (R
   <sub>1</sub>–R
   <sub>5</sub>) and patients to hospitals (1st-L, 2nd-L, and 3rd-L H). Comparatively scenarioing, the sequential-conveyance method is indicated in Panel B.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A theoretical computation is performed to analyze the differences between the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method. As a matter of fact, the number of ambulances in situ is a limiting factor. Consequently, it is assumed that each transferral of an ambulance is an independent event and the time used can be accumulated. According to the concept of this study, casualties with minor injuries are gathered in an MEMC for the basic treatment. On the contrary, all the patients are sent directly to hospitals regardless the condition of the casualties in the conventional method. The T, D, TE, DE, TE versus PR, and DE versus PR are thoroughly deduced and equated in the Supplemental Content,
