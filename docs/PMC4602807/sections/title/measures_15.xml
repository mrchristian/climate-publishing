  </span> has been chosen to simulate the transportation scenarios. The distance and the time interval between each dispatch are calculated by using the route-planning function of Google Map. In the case of Xiaolin, only 16 of 135 casualties in the MEMC were transferred to the different lines of hospitals, after assuming that the residuals were stabilized and readily treated in the MEMC. For a theoretical comparison between the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method, all assumptions are depicted in Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>. In Panel A, the survival flows in the conventional method are represented as survivals (p + q; p, nonpatients; q, patients) in the Xiaolin (X) event are sent to different destinations chaotically. Nonpatients are sent to refuges (R
  <sub>1</sub>–R
  <sub>5</sub>) and patients to hospitals (1st-L, 2nd-L, and 3rd-L H). Comparatively scenarioing, the sequential-conveyance method is indicated in Panel B.
