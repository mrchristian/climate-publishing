 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two versions of casualty transportation are compared: the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method. Both are shown in Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>. In Panel A, the conventional method imitates the real scene of EMS transportation in Xiaolin village; whereas Panel B represents a virtual scenario of the sequential-conveyance method. In the conventional method, all casualties are sent to different lines of hospitals and as a result, anomalies of poor regulation and cross-communication may occur. This allows further diversions among hospitals (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>: Panel A; dashed lines), which are performed frequently, and they are based on matters such as the emergency department (ED) crowding, the poor prehospital triage, and other problems similar to these.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reason why Xiaolin village was selected for this study is its arduous casualty transportation. Jiasion elementary school, a safe and open space near the area of Xiaolin village, is chosen as an MEMC in the sequential-conveyance method. According to the records, all the casualties were transferred to 4 hospitals that can be classified into 3 lines. Chishan and Sijhou Hospital (denoted as 1st-L H), Tainan Municipal Hospital (denoted as 2nd-L H) and Chi Mei Medical Center (denoted as 3rd-L H) are assigned as first-line, second-line, and third-line hospital(s), respectively.</p>
