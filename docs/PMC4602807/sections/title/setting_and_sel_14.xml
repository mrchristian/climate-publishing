  </span> 137 people were found alive and rescued from the calamity-stricken village of Xiaolin during the Typhon Morakot; 16 of them were injured and sent to hospitals for further treatment. The original raw data of referrals are shown in Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>. For the sequential-conveyance method, it is assumed that all the 135 people (the destination of 2 cases has not been registered) were sent to an MEMC and 16 of them were later sent to different lines of hospitals for further treatment. Two major different flow ratios are presented, one of the survivors who were transferred to hospitals and one of the survivors who were transferred to refuges (or a MEMC), to discriminate the patient flow and nonpatient flow between the 2 scenarios of conventional and sequential-conveyance methods. It is worth mentioning that an MEMC is a chimera of a refuge and a disaster-medical-aid center; therefore, all survivors were first sent to an MEMC and some of them were later transferred to hospitals for intensive care.
