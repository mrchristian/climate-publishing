 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasing the connectivity of landscapes to allow species to move in response to climate change is the most-often cited climate change adaption strategy

  </span>. Traditionally, connectivity planning has focused on connecting patches of habitat with what amount to linear strips or stepping-stones of more habitat. Although this approach may allow species to move through the landscape, it may do little to facilitate movement into what might become newly suitable habitat. Early attempts to model connectivity expressly for addressing climate change involved projecting shifts in species distributions through time and either identifying overlap of current and future distributions or mapping pathways that tracked those shifting distributions

  </span>. A more mechanistic application of this approach involved mapping potential corridors through climate-driven shifts in suitable levels of snowpack for wolverines in the northwestern United States

  </span>. Other studies have taken different approaches to identifying important areas for species movement in the face of climate change—approaches that are less reliant on projected future changes in climate and species distributions. Brost and Beier

  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">46</a>
  </span> mapped routes through landscapes that connected slightly warmer patches of intact land to slightly cooler ones with routes that followed gentle temperature gradients and avoided human-impacted landscapes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although efforts continue to develop more relevant climate-connectivity methods, the critical question of whether corridors are really needed—or whether there might be other strategies and approaches that would achieve the same result—has been repeatedly raised 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">37</a>
  </span>. Some argue that the focus on corridors is misguided and that, alternatively, protecting large intact ecosystems should be prioritized

   <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">48</a>
  </span>. Others have argued that the benefits of increasing the size and number of corridors are fewer than those resulting from simply increasing the amount of protected land, which, if regularly distributed, would increase connectivity
