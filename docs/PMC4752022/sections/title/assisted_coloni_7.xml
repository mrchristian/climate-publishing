 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the relatively new tools in the conservation toolbox is assisted colonization—broadly defined by the IUCN as the movement of an organism outside of its native range to avoid extinction of populations due to current or future threats 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-66">66</a>
  </span>. There are some species, particularly endemics with relatively specific habitat requirements and poor dispersal abilities, that will be unable to move to suitable climates. When these species are threatened with extinction—because of either climate change or some other factor—it may become necessary to move them to prevent their loss.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The question of whether assisted colonization should even be considered as an option spawned a lively debate 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-67">67</a>– 
   <a rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-72">72</a>
  </span>. Those opposed to assisted colonization argue that the history of invasive species has taught us that the potential impacts on the ecosystems into which organisms would be moved could be too great 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-68">68</a>
  </span>. Those in favour of keeping the option of assisted colonization on the table argue that it would likely be necessary for preventing the extinction of certain species 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-69">69</a>
  </span>, that the potential impact of translocated species is likely overstated for several reasons 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-69">69</a>, 
   <a rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-71">71</a>
  </span> (including that the traits of species that will need to be moved are not those traits generally associated with invasive species 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-73">73</a>
  </span>), and that the amount of change that systems will experience over the coming decades will likely overshadow the impacts of translocated individuals of a rare and declining species 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-74">74</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the debate worked its ways through the scientific literature, many researchers started to ask more productive questions—facing the reality that assisted colonization was already being used. There were, for example, several early efforts to develop frameworks for determining under what circumstances assisted colonization would be a viable conservation option 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-75">75</a>, 
   <a rid="ref-76" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-76">76</a>
  </span>. Other studies have highlighted the importance of the timing of assisted colonization efforts 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-77" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-77">77</a>
  </span>, developed advanced modelling approaches for identifying potential sites for translocations 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-78" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-78">78</a>
  </span>, and explored the situations in which invasions will be less likely and hence assisted colonization a less risky venture 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-79">79</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, calls for the development of policies to address assisted colonization 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-80" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-80">80</a>
  </span> have begun to be met 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-81" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-81">81</a>, 
   <a rid="ref-82" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-82">82</a>
  </span>. Overall, it appears that, at least in the scientific literature, assisted colonization is gaining acceptance as a tool in the conservation toolbox and one that may not differ so much from other movements of species for conservation reasons
