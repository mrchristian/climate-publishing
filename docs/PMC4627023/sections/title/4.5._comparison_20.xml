 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study conducted SEM to test the TPB variables, and the values of the indicators are as follows: 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <div id="mm10" class="math">
    <div class="mrow">
     <div class="msup">
      <span class="mi">x</span>
      <span class="mn">2</span>
     </div>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div> = 3.774, GFI = 0.828, CFI = 0.920, TLI = 0.902, RMSEA = 0.109 and parsimony goodness-of-fit index (PGFI) = 0.597. The values of the indicators indicate an acceptable fit to the TPB model.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ECC model extends the TPB by introducing BOC as an independent variable. Byrne [
  <a rid="B54-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-12-13162">54</a>] argued that a PGFI value under 0.5 indicates an unacceptable fit to the model. The PGFI value of the ECC model was 0.618, suggesting that the parsimony of the ECC model is acceptable. Moreover, the ECC model explained 61.9% of the variation in IEA, which is greater than that explained by the TPB (58.4%). Thus, the ECC model is superior to the TPB in explaining variation in the intention to purchase energy-efficient appliances.
