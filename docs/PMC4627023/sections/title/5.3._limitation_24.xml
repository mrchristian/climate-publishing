 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ECC model is subject to a number of limitations that can serve as starting points for further research. This study focused on the ECC model in the household sector, and future research may extend this model to other fields, such as offices and housing communities. Four types of electrical appliances were used as items in this study, and further research may extend the model to other appliances or equipment.</p>
