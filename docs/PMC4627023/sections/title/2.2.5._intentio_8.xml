 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pro-environmental behaviors have been grouped into two classes: efficiency behaviors and curtailment behaviors [
  <a rid="B47-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-12-13162">47</a>]. Efficiency behaviors are one-time investments in efficient infrastructure such as a decision to use energy-efficient light. By contrast, curtailment behaviors are repetitive efforts aimed at reducing resource consumption, such as continually ensuring that lights are turned off in unoccupied rooms. Flemming 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B48-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-12-13162">48</a>] emphasized that efficiency behaviors appear to be of greater benefit than curtailment behaviors, as they tend to result in a greater overall reduction in energy use. This study focuses on efficiency behaviors to determine the factors that influenced the households’ intentions to purchase energy-efficient appliances.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have focused on intentions toward efficiency behaviors. For example, Lam [
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-12-13162">22</a>] used the TPB and modified models to predict people’s intention to save water and found that the TPB alone was insufficient to explain the intention to install a dual-flush controller in toilets, whereas an additional variable, the subjective effectiveness of alternative solutions, was a good predictor for such an intention.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clark 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-13162">23</a>] argued that all the TPB variables were significantly positively correlated with water conservation intentions and that an additional variable, self-perceived knowledge of climate change, was also significantly related to such intentions. In addition, EAs and concerns regarding future shortages were significant but relatively weak determinants.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chen 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-12-13162">49</a>] proposed an integrated model that combined the TPB, the technology acceptance model (TAM), and habit to examine private vehicle users’ switching intentions with regard to public transit and found that the habitual behavior of private vehicle use hinders individuals’ intention to switch from a car or motorcycle to public transit.

  <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-13162">23</a>], and Chen

  <a rid="B49-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-12-13162">49</a>], this study considers appliances that Taiwanese citizens continue to use. This study examined intentions to engage in efficiency actions when appliances are replaced, 
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span>ations in which the individual may be willing to purchase energy-saving appliances.
