  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The theory of planned behavior (TPB) is an extension of the theory of reasoned action [
   <a rid="B10-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-12-13162">10</a>,
   <a rid="B11-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-12-13162">11</a>] and is meant to help explain and predict people’s intentions and behaviors [
   <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-13162">12</a>]. According to the TPB, attitudes toward behavior, subjective norms (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC) are usually found to predict behavioral intentions; moreover, intentions in combination with PBC are then used to explain variance in behavior [
   <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-13162">13</a>]. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A central factor in the TPB is the individual’s intention to engage in a given behavior. Intentions are assumed to capture the motivational factors that influence behavior; they are indications of how hard people are willing to try, of how much of an effort they are planning to exert, in order to perform the behavior. Generally, the stronger the intention to engage in a behavior, the more likely the occurrence of the behavior will be. However, a behavioral intention will be expressed as a behavior only if the behavior in question is under volitional control—that is, if the person can decide at will whether to perform the behavior [
   <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-13162">14</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TPB has often been used to examine the pro-environmental intentions or behaviors of various people [
   <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-13162">8</a>]. Using the TPB and the norm activation model (NAM; [
   <a rid="B15-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-12-13162">15</a>]) to examine the energy-saving behavior of households, Abrahamse 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B16-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-12-13162">16</a>] concluded that households use energy in not only direct (e.g., gas, electricity, and fuel) but also indirect (e.g., consuming and disposing of goods) ways and found that the variables of both the TPB and the NAM can explain energy-saving intentions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Klöckner 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-13162">17</a>] studied energy consumption and transportation and concluded that the TPB effectively explained the variation in student passengers’ travel mode of choice. Tikir 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B18-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-12-13162">18</a>] found that the independent variables of the TPB also explained the intention to use public transport. Kerr 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B19-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-12-13162">19</a>] indicated that the behavioral intention of the TPB was the strongest predictor of private vehicle use.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to energy use, the TPB has been applied in some studies to other pro-environmental intentions and behaviors. Aertsens 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B20-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-12-13162">20</a>] reviewed studies on pro-environmental behaviors based on the TPB and the modified TPB models that examined personal determinants of organic food consumption. Aertsens 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B20-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-12-13162">20</a>] concluded that organic food purchases were positively and significantly related to the intention to purchase such food. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In studies of water conservation behaviors, the TPB successfully predicted intentions to save water, and the variables of the TPB were positively and significantly correlated with water conservation intentions [
   <a rid="B21-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-12-13162">21</a>,
   <a rid="B22-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-12-13162">22</a>,
   <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-13162">23</a>]. However, the TPB was less successful in predicting the intention to install water-efficient appliances [
   <a rid="B21-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-12-13162">21</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A meta-analysis from Armitage 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B24-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-12-13162">24</a>] supported the efficacy of the TPB as a predictor of intentions and behavior and suggested that additional normative variables may increase the predictive power of the normative component of the model. Nevertheless, Bamberg and Möser [
   <a rid="B25-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-12-13162">25</a>] posited that bias may have led to an overestimation of the intention–behavior correlation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TPB has been applied to a wide range of human behaviors [
   <a rid="B26-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-12-13162">26</a>], and the TPB and related modified models have often been used to examine the pro-environmental intentions and behaviors of various groups of people [
   <a rid="B10-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-12-13162">10</a>]. Ajzen [
   <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-13162">14</a>] noted that the TPB is open to the inclusion of additional predictors if they can be shown to capture a significant proportion of the variance in intentions or behavior after the theory’s current variables have been taken into account. Thus, to advance analysis using the TPB, this study presents variables to include in the TPB model, among others, that might increase its explanatory power.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attitude has been defined in a variety of ways, but at the core, it is the notion of evaluation. Thus, attitudes are commonly viewed as summary evaluations of objects along a dimension ranging from positive to negative [

    <a rid="B28-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-12-13162">28</a>]. Thus, general behavior should be more closely related to a general environmental attitude (EA) [

    <a rid="B29-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-12-13162">29</a>] indicated that the attitude toward an energy-efficient product has a stronger effect on intentions than the subjective norm component. To determine the predictors of purchasing energy-efficient appliances, both the specific EA under the circumstances of global warming and the attitude of the individual toward purchasing energy-efficient appliances were identified in the efficiency action toward climate change (ECC) model.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of perceived behavioral control in TPB is the non-volitional elements, which can predict the behavioral intention. PBC comprises two separable components, self-efficacy and controllability, and can be considered a unitary latent variable in a hierarchical factor model [
    <a rid="B36-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-12-13162">36</a>]. In pro-environmental behavior studies, PBC and other TPB factors accounted for 95% of intentions with respect to conservation behaviors [
    <a rid="B37-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-12-13162">37</a>]. PBC was also one of the psychological factors that influenced energy-saving behaviors [

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.2.4. Perceived Benefit or Cost (BOC)</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ajzen and Driver [
    <a rid="B38-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-12-13162">38</a>] distinguished behavioral beliefs into two independent types: beliefs about the costs or benefits of engaging in a behavior (instrumental beliefs) and beliefs about positive or negative feelings derived from the behavior (affective beliefs). This study refined the construct of behavioral beliefs by defining instrumental beliefs as the perceived benefit or cost (BOC). Perceived benefits are defined as beliefs about improved conditions or gains produced by a given action, whereas perceived costs involve beliefs about losses engendered by that action.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As with other behaviors, an individual’s BOC influences whether they engage in environmental behaviors; less benefit or more cost reduces the likelihood that individuals will engage in environmental behaviors [
    <a rid="B39-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-12-13162">39</a>]. For example, consumers who were willing to pay a higher price for emulsion lacquer paints with an environmental label expected a personal advantage from using the labeled products [
    <a rid="B40-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-12-13162">40</a>]. Similarly, mothers may have strong concerns about environmental and food safety and may thus be willing to pay more for eco-labeled apples [
    <a rid="B41-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-12-13162">41</a>]. In one study, approximately 49% of Australian tourist respondents were willing to pay extra for hotel accommodations powered by a micro-generation renewable energy supply [
    <a rid="B42-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-12-13162">42</a>]. In another study, aviation passengers were willing to pay 60 Euro Cent per 100 km when they flew to offset their GHG emissions, on average [
    <a rid="B43-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-12-13162">43</a>]. Altruistic and environmental attitudes, along with a greater ability to pay, have been shown to reliably predict willingness to pay a premium price for using green electricity [
    <a rid="B44-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-12-13162">44</a>]. Gaspar

    <a rid="B45-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-12-13162">45</a>] argued that their results indicated a preference for first considering cost, followed by quality and energy consumption.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study distinguishes between PBC and BOC and uses different variables to assess them. PBC is concerned with the perceived ability to perform a behavior (or a sequence of behaviors), and it is quite similar to Bandura’s work on self-efficacy [
    <a rid="B35-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-12-13162">35</a>], whereas BOC indicates that more benefit or less cost would encourage individuals to engage in behaviors based on their behavioral intentions.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, although an incandescent light bulb and an LED light bulb emit the same luminous flux, an incandescent light bulb costs about US$1.57 in Taiwan, whereas an LED light bulb costs about US$4.72. The consumer has the perceived ability to buy both types of light bulbs. If the consumers do not have any more information, the cheap product is always purchased. However, including the BOC analysis in the same cases reveals that the annual electricity bill is approximately US$3.14 for an incandescent light bulb and US$1.50 for an LED light bulb. Thus, it is a good deal for the consumer to choose the LED light bulb over the incandescent light bulb if it will be used for more than 2 years.</p>

    <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-13162">46</a>] and identified BOC as follows: energy-efficient appliances were typically more expensive than traditional appliances, but the reductions in energy bills that were achieved by using energy-efficient appliances totaled more than the premium price.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pro-environmental behaviors have been grouped into two classes: efficiency behaviors and curtailment behaviors [
    <a rid="B47-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-12-13162">47</a>]. Efficiency behaviors are one-time investments in efficient infrastructure such as a decision to use energy-efficient light. By contrast, curtailment behaviors are repetitive efforts aimed at reducing resource consumption, such as continually ensuring that lights are turned off in unoccupied rooms. Flemming 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
    <a rid="B48-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-12-13162">48</a>] emphasized that efficiency behaviors appear to be of greater benefit than curtailment behaviors, as they tend to result in a greater overall reduction in energy use. This study focuses on efficiency behaviors to determine the factors that influenced the households’ intentions to purchase energy-efficient appliances.
   </p>
