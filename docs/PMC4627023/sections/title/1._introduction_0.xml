 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Greenhouse gases (GHGs) can be naturally released (e.g., through volcanic activity) or stored (e.g., in peat). Anthropogenic GHG emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-12-13162">1</a>], and it is difficult for nature to balance the increased concentration of GHGs caused by these activities [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-13162">2</a>]. Notably, Dietz 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-12-13162">3</a>] emphasized that the household sector is one of the major emitters of GHGs; direct energy use by households is responsible for approximately 38% of the overall CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions in the U.S., which amounted to approximately 626 million metric tons of carbon in 2005. Household energy use in the U.S. alone thus accounts for approximately 8% of total global emissions and surpasses the total emissions of any other country, except China. By contrast, in OECD countries, households are responsible for 20% of total CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-13162">4</a>]. Many governments have thus set policies that aim to reduce household energy use and GHG emissions. Despite these policymakers’ efforts, household energy consumption continues to increase, and more effective energy strategies seem to be warranted to reduce household GHG emissions [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mitigating global climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in GHG emissions [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-12-13162">1</a>]. The majority of mitigation or adaptation strategies for climate change are directed at long-term options, such as introducing new low-carbon technologies or creating cap-and-trade regimes for emissions. Most people believe that climate change and sustainability are important problems, but too few global citizens engaged in high-GHG-emitting behaviors to halt the increasing flow of GHGs and other environmental problems [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-12-13162">6</a>]. O’Riordan [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-12-13162">7</a>] has argued that certain carbon-reducing behaviors are not easy to carry out; thus, humans seem to have strong intentions to avoid immediate dangers but weak intentions to avoid long-term threats, a phenomenon that Lin [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-13162">8</a>] has called the gap between global issues and personal behaviors.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Household energy use affects the environment primarily through the burning of fossil fuels either directly or in the generation of electricity. The decisions to reduce households’ energy consumption by choosing energy-efficient electric appliances could contribute to reducing environmental impacts [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-13162">9</a>]. Thus, this study aimed to determine which factors influence households’ intentions to purchase energy-efficient appliances and to offer some suggestions for how the household and industrial sectors might reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions.
