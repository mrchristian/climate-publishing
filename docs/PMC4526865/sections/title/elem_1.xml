  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microhabitat temperature</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intertidal microhabitat temperatures were recorded at 15 exposed to moderately exposed shores along the European Atlantic coast, spanning nearly 20° of latitude, from Southwest Scotland to South Portugal (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>, A – South Cairn, B – Emlagh, C – Holyhead, D – Annascaul, E – Wembury, F – Landunvez, G – Batz-sur-Mer, H – Royan, I – Biarritz, J – Prellezo, K – La Caridad, L – Cabo Touriñan, M – Moledo, N – São Lourenço, O – Evaristo). Data were acquired using robolimpets (autonomous temperature sensing/logging devices mimicking the visual aspect and temperature trajectories of real limpets, see Lima and Wethey
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a> for details). Loggers were deployed following Seabra 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. Temperatures were sampled from 6 distinct combinations of height above the low water mark (low, mid and high shore) and exposure to sun (shaded and sun-exposed), thus covering most of the spectrum of microhabitats occupied by intertidal species. Data were collected continuously between the summers of 2010 and 2014, at a sampling rate of 60 minutes and a resolution of 0.5 °C. For each microhabitat, logged temperatures were averaged whenever data from multiple sensors were available. All data manipulation and analyses were done using R 3.1.2

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 17 ecologically relevant temperature metrics were computed for each shore. Metrics were computed per year and then averaged over the four years of data available. Metrics computed include the mean using all available data for each shore (grand mean), the mean temperature during the hottest/coldest seven days of each year (‘mean 7d’), and the mean daily range of temperatures (‘daily range’), mean daily range of all microhabitats’ maximum temperatures (i.e., microhabitat range, or ‘micro range’), minimum, 5
   <span class="sup">th</span> percentile, mean, 95
   <span class="sup">th</span> percentile and maximum during the hottest/coldest 30 days of each year. For easier terminology, metrics computed during the hottest periods were prefixed “summer”, and metrics computed during the coldest periods were prefixed “winter” (e.g., ‘summer minimum’, ‘winter mean 7d’, etc.). The correlation coefficient between each metric and latitude was also calculated.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Direction of range shifts</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An example is presented to illustrate how range shifts driven by climate change can occur both towards the poles or the equator. We modelled the relative abundance (from 0 – absent, to 1 – highest abundance) of a theoretical species under two climate change scenarios. We modelled an equatorial species which is intolerant of cold stress and tolerant of heat stress. Abundance was determined as the lowest value of either ‘winter minimum’ or ‘summer 5
   <span class="sup">th</span> percentile’ at each shore (following Liebig’s law of the minimum). To allow the comparison of both metrics (which are not equivalent in absolute terms) we normalised each metric to vary from 0 to 1, reflecting the range observed within the study region. Zero abundance occurred at shores where at least one of the metrics had a value of zero, meaning that either ‘winter minimum’ or ‘summer 5
   <span class="sup">th</span> percentile’, or both, prevented the species from existing. Both metrics were used without any change for the initial conditions. The first climate change scenario considers climate change as a monotonic increase of both aspects of temperature, and the abundance pattern was computed using “hot” versions of both ‘winter minimum’ and ‘summer 5
   <span class="sup">th</span> percentile’ (resulting in increased habitat suitability). The second scenario considers climate change as an increase of variability in which some metrics may actually become colder. In this case the abundance pattern was computed using the “cold” version of ‘winter minimum’ and the “hot” version ‘summer 5
   <span class="sup">th</span> percentile’. The initial range limit was identified as the most poleward shore with abundance greater than zero. The location of the range limit was re-evaluated for both climate change scenarios to determine the direction of change (poleward or equatorward).
