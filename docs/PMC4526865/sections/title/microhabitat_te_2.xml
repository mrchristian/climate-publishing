 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intertidal microhabitat temperatures were recorded at 15 exposed to moderately exposed shores along the European Atlantic coast, spanning nearly 20° of latitude, from Southwest Scotland to South Portugal (

Data were acquired using robolimpets (autonomous temperature sensing/logging devices mimicking the visual aspect and temperature trajectories of real limpets, see Lima and Wethey

Temperatures were sampled from 6 distinct combinations of height above the low water mark (low, mid and high shore) and exposure to sun (shaded and sun-exposed), thus covering most of the spectrum of microhabitats occupied by intertidal species. Data were collected continuously between the summers of 2010 and 2014, at a sampling rate of 60 minutes and a resolution of 0.5 °C. For each microhabitat, logged temperatures were averaged whenever data from multiple sensors were available. All data manipulation and analyses were done using R 3.1.2
