 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Without adaptation (i.e., Level 0 both for irrigation and crop variety), wheat yields will fall below the current level in most countries in the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</a>). This is common to all of the climate models and ensemble runs. We found that only a limited number of the adaptation sets could maintain wheat yield near the current level (yield change ≈ ± 10%); late implementation of adaptation leads to a large yield decrease, and early implementation leads to an unnecessary yield increase possibly linked with overinvestment (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the minimum-necessary adaptation set (i.e., the adaptation set that is expected to attain the minimum increase in yield from the current yield) is implemented incrementally in each decade, the adaptation pathways under the RCP8.5 scenario of the MIROC-ESM projection result in the dark blue lines in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Figs 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">2</a>. These pathways indicate the time sequences of necessary adaptation, and they are also assumed to be the results of timely implementation of necessary adaptation; thus, we refer to these pathways as the “timely case.” Adaptation pathways in the timely case are quite different among the countries with regard to the amount and timing of adaptation required (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Figs 1</a>,
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">2</a>). In China and India stronger adaptations will be required over time, whereas in the United States and France, the adaptation needs to be implemented only in the earlier decades and could be kept constant later. The pathways in the United States and Russia could maintain yields near the current level just by switching to existing crop varieties (crop variety Level 1) and increasing the irrigated area ratio by 10% (irrigation Level 1). In contrast, both new heat-tolerant varieties (i.e., crop variety Levels 2 to 5) and increasing the irrigated area ratio by ≥ 50% (i.e., irrigation Levels 5 to 12) will be required to maintain current yields in China, India, Germany, and Pakistan (see Methods). In China, India, and Pakistan, crop land in which the current irrigated area ratio is relatively high ( &gt; ~50%) is widely distributed, such that the irrigated area ratio in the currently irrigated region may reach the upper limit (100%). Expansion of irrigation into current rain-fed crop lands (i.e., irrigation Levels 11 and 12) will be required in India and Pakistan (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Figs 1</a>,
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">2</a>). In Germany, most crop lands are rain-fed, but a substantial expansion of irrigation into the rain-fed areas will be required to maintain current yield (
