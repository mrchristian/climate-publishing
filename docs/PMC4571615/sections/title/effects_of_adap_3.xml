 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because we considered multiple adaptation options (i.e., expansion of irrigation and crop variety alteration), multiple pathways of necessary adaptation could be described by prioritizing one of the adaptation options. In this section, we show effects of these adaptation prioritization strategies on the adaptation pathways, focusing on the results of MIROC-ESM. We also show the adaptation pathways under the different emissions scenario (i.e., the RCP2.6) based on the MIROC-ESM projection in the latter half of this section.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The timely case previously mentioned is a non-prioritization case: the adaptation set that achieves the minimum increase in yield from the current level is chosen regardless of the kind of adaptation option. If either irrigation or crop varieties is preferentially chosen (the prioritized cases; see Methods), the resulting adaptation pathways differ from the timely case (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</a>). For example, in the United States and Russia, although a combination of switching to existing crop varieties and a 10% increase in irrigation could maintain the current yields (timely case), introduction of new heat-tolerant crop varieties will be required if irrigation is not expanded (prioritize variety case). The current yield will be maintained by the adaptation assumed in this study in the timely case and/or prioritized cases in all countries except Germany and Pakistan under the RCP8.5 scenario (note that the wheat yield in Germany is projected to be maintained by the other climate models and ensemble runs; see the previous section). However, the adaptation pathways include a large expansion of irrigation or development of new-heat tolerant varieties in some cases, and the timing of the required adaptation varies with the prioritization of the adaptation options. Decision-makers have to examine adaptations by considering the country-specific adaptive capacity or strategy.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The necessary adaptation levels tend to be lower under the RCP2.6 scenario than under the RCP8.5 scenario, except in the United States and France (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4b</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</a>). In Russia and Canada, the adaptation levels are lower and the timing of implementing adaptation is later than under the RCP8.5 scenario. In China, the yields could be maintained at the current level by switching to existing crop varieties and expanding the irrigated area ratio; the development of new varieties that is required under the RCP8.5 scenario may not be necessary under the RCP2.6 scenario. Unlike the RCP8.5 scenario, the yields could be maintained in Germany and Pakistan under the RCP2.6 scenario. If irrigation is expanded into current rain-fed crop lands (i.e., irrigation Levels 11 and 12) in Germany, the yield could be maintained just by switching to the existing crop varieties. In Pakistan, although new varieties (i.e., crop variety Levels 2 to 5) will be needed even if irrigation is expanded into currently rain-fed crop lands, the likelihood of maintaining the current yield by adaptation would be higher under the RCP2.6 scenario than under the RCP8.5 scenario. In these countries, future climate change will be particularly important for adaptation planning. In other words, climate mitigation policy matters more there. In the United States and France, the adaptation levels are not necessarily lower under the RCP2.6 scenario than under the RCP8.5 scenario. The possible reasons are that under the RCP2.6 scenario either a high level of irrigation or a high level of crop variety is selected in the early decades instead of a combination of adaptation options, and water stress would be higher under the RCP2.6 scenario than under the RCP8.5 scenario in several decades.
