  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The growth-climate responses obtained for the full 1935–2011 period highlight the diversity in climate sensitivity of junipers across different elevations and regions (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s001" href="#pone.0153888.s001">S1 Table</a>). Only junipers in southwest KG showed a distinct precipitation response at lower elevations (Khaidarkan and Krygyz Ata until ~2500 m asl; Karakuldja until ~2000 m asl) and a temperature response at higher altitudes towards the end of the growing season (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s001" href="#pone.0153888.s001">S1 Table</a>). Juniper at all other sites and regions responded either to a lack in water supply or to high temperatures in spring, summer or during the full growing season, i.e. April to October (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s001" href="#pone.0153888.s001">S1</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s002" href="#pone.0153888.s002">S2</a> Tables).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, only a few sites responded to one single climate parameter (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s002" href="#pone.0153888.s002">S2 Table</a>). TRW in KAnw (Kyrgyz Ata, KG), TOH (Karakuldja, KG) and ADJ (Karakol, KG) was positively correlated with temperature, while TRW in SK (Chimgan, UZ), TLL (Karakuldja, KG), SH1 and ARN (both Naryn, KG) showed distinct precipitation associations at monthly to seasonal scales (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s002" href="#pone.0153888.s002">S2 Table</a>). The remaining 26 sites exhibited either a mixed climate response or changing responses over the course of the year. Strong responses to drought, expressed as negative/positive correlations with temperature/precipitation at the same time, were observed for ZNP-JUSE (Zaamin, UZ) and most of the sites in Naryn, central KG, especially in summer but also during the entire vegetation period (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s002" href="#pone.0153888.s002">S2 Table</a>). Regarding changes in climate sensitivity, six (five) sites experienced changing temperature (precipitation) responses during all seasons (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s002" href="#pone.0153888.s002">S2 Table</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summer, a total of seven sites located at higher elevations showed significant positive summer temperature responses, while drought was the dominant growth limiting factor at lower altitudes (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g002" href="#pone.0153888.g002">Fig 2</a>; 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s002" href="#pone.0153888.s002">S2 Table</a>). Thus, an overall linear increasing trend in temperature sensitivity and decreasing trend in precipitation sensitivity with increasing elevation, was observed for both original and high-pass filtered data (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1935–1964 to 1982–2011, winter temperatures increased by 0.6°C to 2.4°C from eastern UZ to eastern KG, whereas the highest increase in summer temperatures of 1.1°C was recorded in central and eastern KG (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g003" href="#pone.0153888.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</a>). Winter rainfall increased by 56 mm in eastern UZ but remained more or less constant in central and eastern KG (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g003" href="#pone.0153888.g003">Fig 3C</a>). The smallest changes in rainfall were observed during summer in the eastern parts of both countries, increasing by 12 mm in northeastern UZ (Chimgan) and southern KG (Karakuldja) (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Distinct changes in the climate response of juniper trees were observed across the study area and with respect to elevation (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g005" href="#pone.0153888.g005">Fig 5</a>). Focusing on the temperature response in JJA, sites located in Zaamin (UZ), Kyrgyz Ata and Karakuldja (southern KG) and Karakol (eastern KG), showed increased negative responses to high temperatures (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g005" href="#pone.0153888.g005">Fig 5A</a>). In contrast, junipers in Chimgan (UZ) seem to be less stressed by warm temperatures in recent decades, and significant changes in correlations were observed at B2H with 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.47 (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g005" href="#pone.0153888.g005">Fig 5B</a>). On the contrary, in the past 30 years at several high elevation sites, junipers have become negatively influenced by high temperatures (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the spatial precipitation responses, all regions except Karakuldja (southern KG) showed increased positive correlations in 1982–2011 compared to 1935–1964 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g005" href="#pone.0153888.g005">Fig 5C</a>), although this was manifested in different ways. Junipers in the east of our study area, e.g. in Chimgan (UZ), showed increases in the positive correlations with precipitation, i.e. at B1H from 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.14 to 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.56 (
   <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;0.01) or ML from 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.17 to 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.53 (
   <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;0.01). However, for junipers in Karakol (eastern KG), where growth was limited by high precipitation during 1935–1964, decreasing precipitation amounts led to improved growing conditions in recent decades. Significant changes in correlation values were found for all three sites but especially for AY (from 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = -0.36 to 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.18) and ADJ (from 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = -0.43 to 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = -0.08) (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s003" href="#pone.0153888.s003">S3B Table</a>). Across all altitudes, a tendency towards increasingly positive correlations with precipitation was observed (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g005" href="#pone.0153888.g005">Fig 5D</a>), suggesting a higher water demand for tree growth also at high elevation sites.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the observed changes were not only restricted to summer. Warmer winters had positive influences on juniper growth at seven sites, while increased spring temperatures negatively affected tree growth at four sites (
