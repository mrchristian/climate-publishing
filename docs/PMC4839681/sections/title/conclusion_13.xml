 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using a unique and extensive juniper network established for the Tien Shan and northern Pamir-Alay mountain ranges, we detected changes in growth-climate responses during the past eight decades. Junipers at low elevation sites mainly increased their climate sensitivity to drought during summer and the entire growing season. At the highest elevation sites, however, juniper growth was favored by high summer temperatures during 1935â€“1964, but was limited by increasing drought conditions during the past ~30 years. This change in climate sensitivity of the junipers likely demonstrates the effect of the ongoing climate change, and also explains the low reconstruction skills of high elevation juniper sites in Central Asia. Across the study area, changes in climate response were detected at all regions during summer, but also during winter, spring and autumn. This may be the cause of the spatially non-uniform changes in growth trends across the study region. Finally, our results indicate that a further rise in temperature together with decreasing rainfall amounts, as predicted for the coming decades, will most likely increase the risk of altitudinal range shifts of

Consequently, alterations in the floral composition of the temperate coniferous forest biome in Central Asia can be expected. We therefore stress the need to apply adequate long-term measures for ecosystem conservation and to consider this ongoing response shift in paleo-climate and model simulation approaches for this region.
