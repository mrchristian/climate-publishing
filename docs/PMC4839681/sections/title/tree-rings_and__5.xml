  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref035">35</a>]. For the development of the individual site TRW chronologies, we first eliminated biases caused by temporally uneven sample replication by applying a power transformation [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref036">36</a>] to each raw TRW series. Dimensionless indices were computed as residuals and age-induced growth trends were removed by applying flexible age-dependent splines [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref037">37</a>] using the software ARSTAN [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref038">38</a>]. This data-adaptive and, at the same time, deterministic standardization procedure uses splines that become progressively inflexible with increasing tree age [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref037">37</a>]. The variance of each final site chronology was stabilized [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref039">39</a>] based on the interseries correlation (Rbar) [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref040">40</a>], and we used robust biweight means of the power transformed, variance stabilized, TRW indices, for which the pooled autoregressive properties of the sites were retained. We truncated each chronology at a replication of 
  <span class="italic">n</span>(

  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref042">42</a>] that fully covers the 1901–2012 period. Temperature and precipitation records were extracted from the nearest grid points to our sampling sites (
