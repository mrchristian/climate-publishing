 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Uzbekistan (UZ) and Kyrgyzstan (KG) belong to a region commonly referred to as Central Asia. This largely semi-arid to arid mountainous region is particularly vulnerable to ongoing and predicted climate change [

  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref002">2</a>]. Temperatures increased during 1901–2009 [

  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref001">1</a>]. The high diversity in topography and land uses modify the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation, and rainfall amounts are expected to further increase in winter, especially in eastern UZ, but decline in summer across the entire region [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed impacts of anthropogenic climate change include an increase in health risks [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref006">6</a>], decrease in agricultural crop productivity [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref003">3</a>], increase in desertification [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref007">7</a>], increase in floods and advanced glacier recession [

  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref009">9</a>], and alterations in phenological phases of species and habitat shifts [

  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref012">12</a>]. Particularly, a potential increase in drought-induced tree mortality and decline in forest vitality [

  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref016">16</a>] and changes in forest productivity [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref017">17</a>] would have dramatic consequences for the forest ecosystem in this region. Besides potential threats to the environment, socio-economy and human health, the unequally distributed water resources in this region are likely to further increase political tensions between the countries [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mountains of Central Asia are classified as one of the 34 biodiversity hotspots in the world [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref020">20</a>]. Under climate change scenarios (A2 and B2) mountain coniferous forest ecosystems are likely to be among the most affected [

  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref022">22</a>]. Juniper (
  <span class="italic">Juniperus</span> spp.) dominates with around 80% of the forested areas at mid-to high elevations in Central Asia [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref023">23</a>]. For UZ, Botman [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref021">21</a>] estimated a future upslope shift of juniper forests of 350–400 meters, consequently leading to an overall spatial reduction of the juniper belts by 350 meters due to less favorable pedogenic conditions at the tree line.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variations in annual tree growth that predominantly reflect weather conditions can be used to detect impacts caused by recent climate changes in response to an increased CO
  <sub>2</sub> content in the atmosphere during the industrial era. In UZ, the mountain conifer forests are confined to the northern Pamir-Alay in the southeast and western Tien Shan ranges in the northwest of the country. Due to political unrest and restricted accessibility, only one dendroclimatological investigation has been conducted in the past decades [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref024">24</a>]. In adjacent KG, research has been done on various economically important tree species in the Tien Shan and northern Pamir-Alay Mountains such as walnut (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref025">25</a>]), spruce (e.g. [

  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref027">27</a>]), and juniper (e.g. [

  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref030">30</a>]). For spruce, distinct and statistically significant trends in climate response as a function of elevation were detected, where spruce growth benefits from warm temperatures at high elevations, while it is limited by water supply at low altitudes [
  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref026">26</a>]. However, the impact of climate on juniper has been shown to be less clear, e.g. [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study aimed to evaluate the climatic signal of juniper along altitudinal gradients in and across eight regions from eastern UZ to eastern KG. We investigated spatial trends and patterns in recent juniper growth using a new and extensive tree-ring width (TRW) network of 33 sites from the northern Pamir-Alay and Tien Shan mountain ranges in UZ and KG. We compared averages of climate, annual TRW increments, and tree growth-climate responses, as a function of elevation, between 1935–1964 and 1982–2011, and mapped differences across the entire study region. Results were discussed in the light of observed changes in climate, tree growth and climate sensitivity in Central Asia and similar regions.</p>
