Alterations in species distribution or drought-induced tree mortality might not only result in a loss of biodiversity but also in a loss of other ecosystem services. Here, we evaluate spatial trends and patterns of the growth-climate relationship in a tree-ring network comprising 33 juniper sites from the northern Pamir-Alay and Tien Shan mountain ranges in eastern Uzbekistan and across Kyrgyzstan for the common period 1935&#x02013;2011. Junipers growing at lower elevations are sensitive to summer drought, which has increased in intensity during the studied period. At higher elevations, juniper growth, previously favored by warm summer temperatures, has in the recent few decades become negatively affected by increasing summer aridity. Moreover, response shifts are observed during all seasons. Rising temperatures and alterations in precipitation patterns during the past eight decades can account for the observed increase in drought stress of junipers at all altitudes. The implications of our findings are vital for the application of adequate long-term measures of ecosystem conservation, but also for paleo-climatic approaches and coupled climate-vegetation model simulations for Central Asia.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was partially funded by Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien (KVA, including the Margit Althins Stipendiefond), Svenska S&#x000e4;llskapet f&#x000f6;r Antropologi och Geografi (SSAG), Wilhelm och Martina Lundgrens Vetenskapsfond and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency SIDA (project SWE-2009-245).

Juniper (<italic>Juniperus</italic> spp.) dominates with around 80% of the forested areas at mid-to high elevations in Central Asia [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For UZ, Botman [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] estimated a future upslope shift of juniper forests of 350&#x02013;400 meters, consequently leading to an overall spatial reduction of the juniper belts by 350 meters due to less favorable pedogenic conditions at the tree line.</p><p>Variations in annual tree growth that predominantly reflect weather conditions can be used to detect impacts caused by recent climate changes in response to an increased CO<sub>2</sub> content in the atmosphere during the industrial era. In UZ, the mountain conifer forests are confined to the northern Pamir-Alay in the southeast and western Tien Shan ranges in the northwest of the country. Due to political unrest and restricted accessibility, only one dendroclimatological investigation has been conducted in the past decades [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In adjacent KG, research has been done on various economically important tree species in the Tien Shan and northern Pamir-Alay Mountains such as walnut (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), spruce (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and references therein; [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]), and juniper (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]). For spruce, distinct and statistically significant trends in climate response as a function of elevation were detected, where spruce growth benefits from warm temperatures at high elevations, while it is limited by water supply at low altitudes [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the impact of climate on juniper has been shown to be less clear, e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>This study aimed to evaluate the climatic signal of juniper along altitudinal gradients in and across eight regions from eastern UZ to eastern KG. We investigated spatial trends and patterns in recent juniper growth using a new and extensive tree-ring width (TRW) network of 33 sites from the northern Pamir-Alay and Tien Shan mountain ranges in UZ and KG. We compared averages of climate, annual TRW increments, and tree growth-climate responses, as a function of elevation, between 1935&#x02013;1964 and 1982&#x02013;2011, and mapped differences across the entire study region.

Thus, the climate is extremely continental with cold winters, hot/dry summers, and a precipitation maximum in spring (see climate charts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A decreasing aridity trend from west to east during summer can be observed, altering the climate from semi-arid (until Naryn, central KG) to wet continental at the most eastern region in KG (Karakol; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Moreover, at the highest elevation sites (&#x0003e; ~2500 m asl), the climate is strongly affected by altitude displaying a more alpine climate regime, especially in Khaidarkan, Karakuldja, Naryn and Karakol with low annual temperatures (annual temperature averages are given in the climate charts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Juniperus</italic> (<italic>J</italic>.; locally called &#x02018;Archa&#x02019;) is the dominant taxa at mid- to high altitudes (1200&#x02013;3500 m asl).

This was done to attempt to find a causal link between juniper growth and climate response to observed changes in climate during the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

Changes in juniper growth were calculated by averaging the TRW indices over the two 30-year periods.

At some sites and regions, old and slow-grown trees were found such as at KS (Naryn, KG) or ZNP-JUSE (UZ) with chronologies extending back to AD 1269 and 1482 (un-truncated; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s001">S1 Table</xref>), respectively. However, further endeavors are necessary to develop well-replicated and robust millennial-long chronologies as shown by Seim <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. On the other hand, junipers at some sites were comparatively young in age, for instance at AE and KM (Naryn, KG), pointing to large-scale clear cuts at the end/beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup>/20<sup>th</sup> century. At both sites, single juniper individuals with ages of ~470 years (AE) and ~350 years (KM) were found. However, strong differences in growth variations between old and young trees hampered successful crossdating, and TRW measurements of those old trees were excluded in this study, restricting our common period to 1935&#x02013;2011.</p><p>It is important to note that the CRU grid points (<italic>n</italic> = 12) located closest to the sampling sites (with an average linear distance of ~ 14 km from the sampling sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</xref>), might not fully represent local climate conditions. By comparing observations from the closest available meteorological stations (average linear distance of ~ 29 km from the sampling sites) in KG and UZ [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] for the baseline period 1961&#x02013;1990, absolute annual temperatures derived from the CRU grid point data were on average lower (2.3&#x000b0;C) than those obtained from the stations. This is especially evident in winter where the temperature differences were up to 3.3&#x000b0;C, whereas summer temperatures differed only by 1.5&#x000b0;C. For precipitation, overall drier conditions were observed in the CRU data compared to the instrumental data, especially during summer, with an average of 40 mm less rainfall. However, it is also not expected that even meteorological station data might fully represent the climate condition at the sampling sites due to differences in elevation, as discussed by Seim <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Nevertheless, overall long-term trends in temperature and precipitation anomalies for the CRU and station data are in high agreement as shown by Harris <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>By choosing two climatological periods at each end of this time window, we detected changes in climate and in the climate sensitivity of the juniper trees. However, less distinct results were obtained when using variations in juniper growth since the trees respond not only to sudden changes in climate but also to human impacts, stand dynamics (i.e. competition) and other abiotic and biotic disturbance factors [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, adding information of tree growth for longer time scales would make the interpretation more robust.</p><p>It should be noted that spatial interpolation methods use the maximum range of given values and thus, might be biased by single sites, i.e. data points, while altitudinal differences at the same location are captured only insufficiently. The IDW applied here, however, is a valuable tool to present geographical point data spatially with high efficiency and easy interpretation skills [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The observed changes in climate during the past ~80 years are in accordance with previous findings for Central Asia (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). Our results confirm a spatially uniform temperature increase while trends in precipitation regimes are highly diverse across the study region. Shifts in climatic means are additionally enhanced by feedback mechanisms such as increased evaporation due to rising temperatures, changes in snow cover (depth and duration) and in glacier resources [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although increased greenhouse gas emissions caused a warming of the atmosphere over the past century [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the observed climatic trends and patterns across Central Asia are most likely attributed to 1) feedback mechanisms with the diverse topography and land use [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and 2) observed changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. In the latter case, our 1982&#x02013;2011 period concurs with an exceptionally strong positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation since the 1980s, which contributed to higher than normal winter temperatures, not only in northern Europe, but also in Central Asia [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, an increase in spring to autumn hot extremes was observed in western and central Asia during the last 30 years, associated with an increase in persistent anticyclonic pressure systems [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Although changes in climate during the past eight decades were remarkable and comparatively rapid, trends in juniper growth are less obvious and uniform. Combining the obtained results, we can summarize that juniper trees at the sites in Karakol, KG, with humid growing season climate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</xref>) seem to have benefited from drier summers and consequently, showed increasing growth rates. Conversely, the drier and warmer sites in our study region (i.e. Zaamin, UZ, or Naryn, KG) showed no increases, or slight declines, in annual increments over the analyzed period. Our results, although not being very distinct, are in agreement with general trends observed for semi-arid environments in Asia and Europe. Liu <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] found significant reductions in tree growth for a compilation of various coniferous species in Inner Asia from 1994 onwards, particularly at semi-arid sites. Also, Galvan <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], reviewing 66 dendrochronological studies including different broadleaf and coniferous species from more than 640 sites, detected an overall tendency of positive (negative) growth trends at temperate (xeric) sites across the Mediterranean Basin since the 1970&#x02019;s. Differences in juniper growth at different sites can be linked to different physiological responses regarding gas exchange and water use. Increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have been related to increased intrinsic water-use efficiency, where increased drought stress can lead to reduced stomatal conductance to compensate water loss at the expense of secondary growth [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, detailed studies are needed on 1) all three juniper subspecies as individual tree species seem to perform differently, e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and 2) trees from different climate regimes and sites across Central Asia. Moreover, changes in climate responses during winter and spring may additionally modify annual growth as has previously been reported for spruce at tree-line sites in Alaska, where warmer July temperatures lead to a decline in growth and warmer springs enhanced growth [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>Over the full 1935&#x02013;2011 period, the growth-climate relationships of the juniper sites generally showed benefiting effects on tree growth from warm temperatures at high altitudes and abundant moisture supply at low elevation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g002">Fig 2</xref>), agreeing with the general assumption of limiting factors on tree growth [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Although the temperature signal in the juniper TRW data was not as strong and statistically significant as, for example, in conifers from tree-line sites in the European Alps [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] or the Tibetan Plateau [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], our results are in accordance with findings from earlier studies in KG [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and UZ [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The most likely cause for the relatively low number of statistically significant correlations between juniper growth (i.e. TRW) from high elevations and temperature are temporal instabilities in the climate signal, as indicated by our results. We found distinct response shifts where junipers from high elevation sites were becoming increasingly drought stressed during the past 30 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g005">Fig 5</xref>), a result that not only deviates from the principle of uniformitarianism but also from the principle of limiting factors of tree growth in high mountain environments [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Shifting growth-climate responses have also been detected at high elevation conifer sites in Europe (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]), restricting the development of temperature reconstructions, or for bristlecone pines near the tree line in the White Mountains of California, USA [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>Conversely, junipers at lower altitudes showed distinct and persistent drought responses, which has previously been shown for <italic>J</italic>. <italic>seravschanica</italic> in the Zaamin National Park, UZ [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

However, increasing temperatures and more frequent droughts that are predicted for the future [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], are likely to increase the risk of forest decline, starting at lower elevations [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, upslope shifts of the juniper forests due to increased tree mortality can be expected, which can occur rapidly and over large areas, as observed for a semi-arid ecotone in northern New Mexico after a severe drought event [<xref rid="pone.0153888.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>The identified growth-climate response shifts in our study, which occurred only within the past 40 to 50 years, most likely indicate impacts of the ongoing climate change on juniper growth in Central Asia. We therefore stress the importance of long-term conservation measures to counteract possible losses or reductions of the mountain juniper forest ecosystems in UZ and KG. Our findings also highlight the need of time-dependency analyses in paleo-climatological studies when using high elevation juniper trees, as well as the integration of growth-climate response shifts when assessing and predicting vegetation dynamics in Central Asia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using a unique and extensive juniper network established for the Tien Shan and northern Pamir-Alay mountain ranges, we detected changes in growth-climate responses during the past eight decades. Junipers at low elevation sites mainly increased their climate sensitivity to drought during summer and the entire growing season. At the highest elevation sites, however, juniper growth was favored by high summer temperatures during 1935&#x02013;1964, but was limited by increasing drought conditions during the past ~30 years. This change in climate sensitivity of the junipers likely demonstrates the effect of the ongoing climate change, and also explains the low reconstruction skills of high elevation juniper sites in Central Asia. Across the study area, changes in climate response were detected at all regions during summer, but also during winter, spring and autumn. This may be the cause of the spatially non-uniform changes in growth trends across the study region. Finally, our results indicate that a further rise in temperature together with decreasing rainfall amounts, as predicted for the coming decades, will most likely increase the risk of altitudinal range shifts of <italic>Juniperus</italic> spp. and local drought-induced juniper die-backs in this biodiversity hotspot. Consequently, alterations in the floral composition of the temperate coniferous forest biome in Central Asia can be expected.
