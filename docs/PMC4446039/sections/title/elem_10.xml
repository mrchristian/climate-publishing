 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change vulnerability index values for the 213 threatened species assessed ranged from 11.3 (extremely vulnerable) for the mountain pygmy possum (
  <span class="italic">Burramys parvus</span>) to -5 (low vulnerability) for the western quoll (

  <a rid="pone.0124766.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124766.s004">S3 Table</a>). By convention, a score above four indicates moderate or high climate change vulnerability, while a value below -2.0 indicates that the species might benefit from climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref026">26</a>]. Mean vulnerability index across species was 3.6, and the median was 3.8, with most species showing intermediate levels of vulnerability and relatively few showing particularly low or high vulnerability (
  <a rid="pone.0124766.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124766.s004">S3 Table</a>). Indeed, the frequency distribution of index values was not significantly different from normal (Shapiro-Wilk test: W = 0.992, p = 0.275). Ninety-six species (45.1% of the total) had an index value exceeding 4.0, indicating that nearly half of Australiaâ€™s threatened species considered are moderately to highly vulnerable to climate change (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main factors driving climate change vulnerability were dependence on a particular disturbance regime (typically fire), reliance on a particular moisture regime or habitat, and low genetic variation (
  <a rid="pone.0124766.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0124766.t002">Table 2</a>). Different factors were important for different taxonomic groups, with reliance on particular moisture regimes and low genetic variation being most important for amphibians and reptiles, reliance on disturbance regimes and low genetic variation affecting birds and mammals, and poor dispersal ability and reliance on particular disturbance and moisture regimes affecting plants (
  <a rid="pone.0124766.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0124766.t002">Table 2</a>). On average, birds were affected by the smallest number of factors (2.7), whilst amphibians (4.5) and plants (4.4) were affected by the most, suggesting that these latter groups will require a more complex portfolio of management actions to help them adapt to climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Five factors stood out as having a pervasive influence on the assessed threatened species across much of Australia (
  <a rid="pone.0124766.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0124766.g003">Fig 3</a>). These were reliance on a particular abiotic feature or derivative, reliance on a particular moisture regime or habitat, poor dispersal ability, reliance on a particular disturbance regime and low genetic variation (refer to 
  <a rid="pone.0124766.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0124766.t001">Table 1</a> for complete descriptions of factors). Reliance on other species for propagule dispersal was uncommon among our sample of species although prevalent in the south-west corner of Western Australia and Tasmania, where two 
  <span class="italic">Daviesia</span> species rely mainly on ants for seed dispersal [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref038">38</a>]. Reliance on other species for pollination showed a similar pattern, affecting species along the eastern coastline, south-west Western Australia and northernmost Northern Territory. Reliance on cool temperatures, reliance on other species for diet and a reliance on species for other interactions (eg. mycorrhizal symbiosis) were all predominant factors in south-east Australia and Tasmania. A reliance of one species on other species for suitable habitat was the most prominent factor in western and north-west Queensland, while proximity to anthropogenic barriers mostly affected species along the south coast of the continent. Only the eight numerically most important factors are shown in 
  <a rid="pone.0124766.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0124766.g003">Fig 3</a>. Factors not shown are exposure to rising sea levels and proximity to natural barriers which affected only coastal species and those on either side of the Great Dividing Range, and reliance on snow cover which is confined to the Alps bioregion.
