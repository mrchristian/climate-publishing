 <div class="title">The spatial distributions of the species affected by the eight most important factors driving climate change vulnerability of threatened species in Australia.</div>
 <p>The shading darkens as the proportion of species occurring in the bioregion is affected by each factor; a) reliance on particular abiotic features or derivatives for habitat, b) reliance on other species for habitat, c) reliance on a particular moisture regime or habitat, d) proximity to anthropogenic barriers, e) poor dispersal ability, f) pollinator versatility, g) reliance on a particular disturbance regime, and h) low genetic variation. To aid in the interpretation of proportions, the distribution of threatened species richness is shown in i). The spatial distributions of speciesâ€™ vulnerability to seven supplementary factors is illustrated in (
