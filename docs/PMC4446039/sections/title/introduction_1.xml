 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change poses a serious and accelerating threat to species and ecosystems worldwide [

  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref003">3</a>]. Along with habitat loss through human land use, climate change is a major contributor to biodiversity loss in the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref004">4</a>]. Assessments of the extent to which species are vulnerable to climate change allow us to evaluate the relative importance of the threat of climate change against the range of other threats facing species [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref005">5</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref006">6</a>]. However, while many such assessments exist [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref013">13</a>], studies tend to focus on a single region, species or taxonomic group and to our knowledge none has yet mapped the individual drivers spatially. As a consequence there remains considerable uncertainty about where and how we should take on-ground action to help vulnerable species adapt to climate change [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several approaches have been used to assess vulnerability to climate change. These range from assessments of climate change processes coupled with literature-based evaluations of how these might affect species or ecosystems [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref015">15</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref016">16</a>], to the use of species distribution models predicting the change in geographic distribution required for a species to track suitable climatic conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref008">8</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref017">17</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref020">20</a>]. Another method is to generate climate change vulnerability indices that summarise detailed information on the sensitivity of species to climate change and their adaptive capacity to respond to changing conditions, as well as their exposure to a changing climate [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref008">8</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref021">21</a>]. Sensitivity is determined by the adaptive capacity and resilience of a species, and depends on intrinsic traits such as physiological tolerances, biological traits and genetic diversity [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref021">21</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref022">22</a>]. Exposure expresses the magnitude of the change in the climatic conditions (e.g. temperature, precipitation) within the geographic area occupied by the species. Vulnerability indices are often expressed as a overall measure of the potential harm of climate change to a species or ecosystem and can be summarised in a single number, but because they are built on detailed information about the factors driving climate change vulnerability, they can also be decomposed to reveal spatial and taxonomic variation in the underlying causes of climate change vulnerability. Pinpointing these causes can help begin the process of designing management actions aimed at addressing them. Here we assess which factors drive climate change vulnerability, and how those drivers are distributed spatially. Designing a set of management actions for climate adaptation therefore depends on (i) a clear understanding of the extent to which species are vulnerable to climate change, (ii) knowledge about which aspects of a species’ ecology drive its climate change vulnerability, and (iii) information on how species affected by the various drivers of climate change vulnerability are spatially distributed.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assessments of species’ vulnerability to climate change have multiplied rapidly following the development of vulnerability assessment toolkits and frameworks (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref023">23</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref026">26</a>]). Gardali et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref011">11</a>] used exposure and sensitivity to assess 358 Californian birds, classifying 36% of them as vulnerable to climate change. A recent global assessment based on species traits concluded that 24% of birds, 22% of amphibians and 15% of corals are highly climate change vulnerable under an optimistic climate change scenario, rising to 50%, 44% and 32% respectively under a pessimistic climate change scenario [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref023">23</a>]. The same study demonstrated relatively low spatial congruence between the distributions of species with high exposure, high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity, suggesting that different aspects of climate change vulnerability may be important in different places. Here we further expand on this work by mapping the distributions of species affected by individual climate change vulnerability factors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper we determine the factors driving climate change vulnerability for a representative set of 213 threatened species across Australia. We (i) assess the climate change vulnerability of the species accounting for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, (ii) identify which species and taxonomic groups are most vulnerable to climate change, and (iii) determine the spatial distribution of species affected by each climate change vulnerability factor. We associate specific climate change vulnerability factors with the areas in which the species occur, indicating which climate adaptation actions (management to conserve species in a changing climate) will be needed in each bioregion across the continent. In so doing, we pave the way for building a spatially explicit prioritisation of management actions to protect threatened species under climate change.</p>
