  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref026">26</a>]. This index was developed according to the framework produced by Williams et al. [

  <a rid="pone.0124766.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124766.s003">S2 Table</a>) and intrinsic sensitivity to climate change (sixteen factors;

Based on analysis of relevant literature, we scored each factor according to its contribution to each species’ vulnerability: ‘decrease vulnerability’ (DV), ‘somewhat decrease vulnerability’ (SDV), neutral (N), ‘somewhat increase vulnerability’ (SIV), ‘increase vulnerability’ (IV), ‘greatly increase vulnerability’ (GIV;

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that a species may only be scored on dietary versatility OR pollinator versatility and measured genetic variation OR occurrence of recent population bottlenecks (described in text as ‘low genetic variation’). Owing to limited data availability, in our assessment we did not include ‘predicted impact of land use change resulting from human responses to climate change’,‘historical thermal or hydrological niche’or ‘phenological response to climate change’, which are available for scoring in the original NatureServe index [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indirect exposure and sensitivity factors were combined and weighted by direct exposure to generate a continuous climate change vulnerability index value for each species (for full detail see: [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref026">26</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref030">30</a>]). For this purpose scores of each factor (those comprising indirect exposure and sensitivity) were translated into a numerical value (DV = -2, SDV = -1, N = 0, SIV = 1, IV = 2, GIV = 3), where multiple categories were scored as an average of the two categories used. The numerical value for each factor was then multiplied by an index of direct exposure to climate change based on the proportion of the species’ geographic distribution exposed to different magnitudes of changing mean annual temperature and mean annual moisture index ([
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref030">30</a>], 
  <a rid="pone.0124766.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124766.s002">S1 Table</a>). The values for each factor were then summed to produce the overall index value. The NatureServe approach assigns the final numerical score to a category of climate change vulnerability (eg. moderately vulnerable). However, we here used the underlying continuous values to allow a finer grained analysis. The final index value therefore integrates information on (i) sensitivity, as estimated from biological traits, (ii) indirect exposure to climate change, as estimated from the spatial overlap between the species’ distribution and three indirect exposure factors (natural barriers, anthropogenic barriers and sea-level rise), and (iii) direct exposure to climate change as estimated from climate projections within the geographic distribution of the species. Species that have both high sensitivity and high exposure to rapid climate change ultimately score as the most climate change vulnerable. Sparse information often limited the number of factors that we could assess, but a minimum of 13 out of the 20 sensitivity and indirect exposure factors is required by the NatureServe index to estimate overall vulnerability ([
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref026">26</a>]; the factors we used are listed in 
  <a rid="pone.0124766.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0124766.t001">Table 1</a>). Sufficient information was available for 213 out of the 232 species initially selected (
  <a rid="pone.0124766.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124766.s007">S2 Dataset</a>). The NatureServe approach focuses on the intrinsic traits and physiological characteristics of a species and does not include geographic range size or anthropogenic threats to the species. This renders the index comparable among species with differing conservation status or geographic range size.
