 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A set of 77 simulations from global climatic models (GCM) was used for syrup production season projections [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref019">19</a>], belonging to three greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref020">20</a>]. Simulated daily data, necessary to compute changes in sap flow dates and total production, were obtained for three temporal horizons: 1971–2000 (reference), 2046–2065 (2050 horizon) and 2081–2100 (2090 horizon). To build local climatic scenarios adapted for the projection of future maple syrup production, a post-processing method (“daily translation”) was applied on the raw climate model data variables of daily min and max temperatures and daily precipitation [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref021">21</a>]. The required reference database of daily observations needed for the post-processing procedure was obtained from the ~10km x 10km gridded daily data described in Hopkinson et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref022">22</a>] and Hutchinson et al. [
