 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we built models capable of predicting the start and the end (and thereby length) of the maple syrup production period based on a unique data set of weekly observations made at 121 maple stands spread in 11 regions of the province of Québec (which is responsible for 75% of the world sugar maple syrup production). There was a strong spatial and temporal variability in the timing of the production period. In warmer regions, production began on average 17 days earlier as compared to colder regions. The average date of the beginning of production can be predicted with success with the average temperature from January to April. A logistic model using climatic variables associated with the physiological process of sap flow was also built from the 143 individual observations (13 years x 11 regions) for predicting the period of syrup production. When used in combination with 77 global climate scenarios, the models predict that the period of production will begin 9–13 and 15–19 days earlier for the 2046–2065 and 2081–2100 periods, respectively, but its length is not projected to change. The strong agreement between the two independent models suggests a robust assessment of the changes in timing. The results also show that there will be a higher frequency of extreme years with short season of production in the future, especially in the southern part of the province. However, according to our projections, this would not be sufficient to quantitatively increase the inter-annual variability in the dates of beginning and end of the production season. Given that predicting “extreme” years with very short season of production is more difficult than predicting “average years” in terms of production season timing, and considering that the data available for model calibration covered a relatively short period of time (13 years), caution is warranted when interpreting the projected occurrence of “short seasons” in the future. More research is needed to further investigate this possibility and to assess the potential impacts on maple syrup yield.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the results show that syrup producers will be facing sap seasons starting earlier than at present which means that they must adapt by being ready to tap the sugar maple trees earlier in the season. On the other hand, the projected stability of the inter-annual variability in the beginning of the sap season, indicate that the syrup producers will not be confronted to a greater between years uncertainty with regards to the moment of tapping the trees.</p>
