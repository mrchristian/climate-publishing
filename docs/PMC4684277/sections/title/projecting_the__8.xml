 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model previously obtained for predicting the start, end and length of the production season was run with the 77 climatic scenarios to predict the impact of climate change on the timing and duration of the maple syrup production for each of the 11 regions (
  <a rid="pone.0144844.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0144844.g001">Fig 1</a>). Weekly predictive climate variables used in the timing and duration were first calculated for all simulated years. For each of the 77 climate scenarios, each simulated year of data is used to determine the start, end and length of the syrup production season using the timing and duration model.
