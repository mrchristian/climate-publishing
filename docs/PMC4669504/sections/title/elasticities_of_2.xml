 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For RHBN and non-RHBN watersheds, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> ranges 0.442–3.295 and 0.285–9.305, with a mean value of 1.279 and 2.218, respectively (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Tables S1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S2</a>). Higher 
  <span class="italic">n</span> means higher 
  <span class="italic">E</span> for a given 
  <span class="italic">P</span> and 
  <span class="italic">E</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">p</span>
  </sub>, and hence a lower runoff (
  <span class="italic">R</span>). For example, non-RHBN watersheds #4 and #13 have similar 
  <span class="italic">P</span> (about 1000 mm) and 
  <span class="italic">E</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">p</span>
  </sub> (about 700 mm), but watershed #4 has high 
  <span class="italic">R</span> (about 500 mm) because of low 
  <span class="italic">n</span> (1.525) while watershed #13 has low 
  <span class="italic">R</span> (about 350 mm) because of high 
  <span class="italic">n</span> (2.712). From periods-1 to -2, most southern (northern) watersheds have become wetter (drier), as

  <span class="italic">P</span> in the south (north) decreases (increases). 
  <span class="italic">E</span>/
  <span class="italic">P</span> tends to increase especially in CR but it also decreases elsewhere (

  <span class="italic">P~E</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">p</span>
  </sub>/
  <span class="italic">P</span> relationships for most watersheds in periods-1 and -2 do not follow the same Budyko curve (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</a>), which likely implies that streamflow changes were induced by human impacts, especially when they change in an opposite manner.

As expected, streamflow of the semi-arid Canadian Prairies (CP), which comprises of Alberta (AB), Saskatchewan (SK), and Manitoba (MB), is highly sensitive to LUCC, but less sensitive to LUCC in CR and northern Canada, e.g., absolute values of
