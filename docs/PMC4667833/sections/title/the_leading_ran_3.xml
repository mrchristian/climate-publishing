 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While mean temperatures are increasing almost everywhere on Earth, the magnitude and frequency of extreme cold events are generally changing at much slower and idiosyncratic rates (Kodra et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0039">2011</a>). Therefore, locally‐adapted populations at species' cold range edges could become a key component for species survival. Cold adaptation in trees is not yet fully understood, but it is likely to be controlled by the complex interactions of dozens of different genes, each with small individual effect sizes (Howe et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0033">2003</a>). Local cold adaptations lead to the optimal balance between growth and avoidance of potentially damaging freezing events during the local growing season (Howe et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0033">2003</a>). Common‐garden experiments highlight that reductions in performance outside of the home site are usually attributed to asynchrony between an individual's genetically determined growth phenology and the optimal growing season at the planting site (Howe et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0033">2003</a>; Savolainen et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0062">2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local adaptations, such as the timing of tissue growth to minimize freezing damage while maximizing growing season length (Kollas et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0040">2014</a>), may be necessary for individuals to persist in species' current cold range edges. Indeed, latitudinal and altitudinal treelines are thought to occur at the point where cold temperatures directly limit tree growth, and therefore, optimizing growth during the short growing season while avoiding potentially lethal freezing events is a necessary prerequisite for populations inhabiting the treeline ecotone. Under future climate scenarios, local adaptations such as those found in treeline populations will also be necessary for populations to experience range expansion via colonization of areas becoming newly suitable under warmer temperatures. The lack of cold‐adapted individuals will effectively reduce the species' fundamental niche breadth and hence reduce the geographic extent of suitable areas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasing mean temperatures have advanced the spring growth patterns of many North American trees, such that they now initiate growth earlier in the spring making them more vulnerable to spring frost events (Gu et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0023">2008</a>; Augspurger 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0003">2013</a>). This pattern of increased freezing damage due to accelerated spring phenology can be seen across large geographic areas, which encompass the entire ranges of many tree species (Gu et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0023">2008</a>). If the selective pressures of avoiding spring frost events remain constant or increase under future climates, then we can predict that the more conservative growth patterns of cold‐adapted populations (i.e., delayed onset of spring growth) such as those found at treeline ecotones will be favored. If this is the case, warm‐adapted populations could be prevented from expanding or shifting their ranges. In contrast, cold‐adapted populations may maintain their current distributions as well as expand into areas that become climatically suitable under climate change (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31645-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0001">1</a>B).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While spring phenology is largely temperature dependent, growth cessation and bud set in the fall is mostly governed by photoperiod (Böhlenius et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0004">2006</a>). As tree species migrate poleward, especially into unforested areas beyond current latitudinal treelines, adjustment to the new photoperiods as a cue for fall bud set will be critical for minimizing exposure to the damaging frost events that become more likely as days become shorter. Given that local photoperiod will not be affected by global warming and if fall frost events exert a strong selective pressure on local populations, then we can predict that populations that are locally‐adapted to an area's specific photoperiod patterns will be favored at that location despite rising temperatures. As a result, populations occurring at species' current latitudinal cold range edges may be able to persist longer than would be predicted based on changes in temperature alone. Likewise, these range‐edge populations will be the best‐adapted to the photoperiods occurring in any areas poleward of the current distribution that become newly suitable under climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to local adaptations to cold temperatures and photoperiod, range‐edge populations are simply the closest populations in geographic space to the areas that are likely to become newly climatically suitable in the future. Hence, leading range‐edge populations represent the most likely dispersal sources for the individuals that will recruit into and colonize these newly suitable areas. Furthermore, in some tree and invasive plant species, populations at the cold or leading range edge show traits that enhance the potential for long‐distance seed dispersal (Cwynar and MacDonald 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0012">1987</a>; Moran and Alexander 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0052">2014</a>). Given that many species' current distributional shifts are lagging well behind climate shifts (Chen et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0010">2011</a>), the need for increased dispersal ability will become even more important in the future.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Large‐scale anthropogenic habitat disturbances near species' cold range edges could fragment and eliminate important leading range‐edge populations. For example, expansive forest clearing to make way for pastoral or agricultural lands has already occurred at many alpine treelines that are the cold range edges of numerous montane tree species (Körner 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0041">2012</a>). Similarly, a combination of fires and deforestation of temperate forests at and around latitudinal treelines continues at a high rate (Payette et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0055">2001</a>). Even once anthropogenic disturbances have ceased at these cold or leading species range edges, repopulation of the former range limit occurs slowly, if at all (Holtmeier and Broll 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0032">2005</a>). Therefore, it is likely that the loss and fragmentation of high‐latitude and high‐elevation forests is removing well‐adapted local populations that will be pivotal in allowing species to persist in their former and current ranges and expand their ranges under future climates, even in the absence of continuing human disturbance.
