 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where might drought‐adapted populations occur?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our understanding of intraspecific variation in drought tolerances in tropical trees is limited (McDowell et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0050">2008</a>; Craven et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0011">2013</a>). That said, it is reasonable to assume that many or most widespread Amazonian species exhibit some degree of local adaptation to moisture conditions given the ubiquity of genetic clines across temperature and moisture gradients in temperate species (Savolainen et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0062">2007</a>; McDowell et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0050">2008</a>). To highlight the potential for Amazonian plant species to exhibit local adaptations to moisture stress, we mapped the total annual precipitation (TAP; mm yr‐1) TAP (mm) and maximum climatological water deficit (MCWD; mm) across the distributions of 2157 widespread and large‐ranged tree species (estimated range size ≥300,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) within the Amazon. MCWD is an integrative measure of the accumulative water stress experienced by plants in an area over the course of a year and has previously been found to be a strong predictor of species distributions as well as the location of humid tropical forests and other tropical biomes (Malhi et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0049">2009</a>). For a full description of the methods, see Data S1.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The range of MCWD values occurring within the distributions of widespread tree species' was a median of 321 mm (95% confidence interval: 29.8–523 mm; Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31645-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0002">2</a>A). Based on the geographic distribution of MCWD values in the Amazon, this corresponds to an estimated median range extent of more than 3000 km (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31645-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0002">2</a>B). Local adaptation to drought and summer moisture stress in populations of temperate species can be found over distances of just tens to hundreds of kilometers (Rehfeldt et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0058">1999</a>; St Clair et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0066">2005</a>). We found that Amazonian species experience large differences in MCWD across species' ranges, and that these differences occur over large geographic distances. Therefore, our findings support the contention that many of these tropical species are likely to maintain strong local adaptations to moisture stress conditions. More specifically, we predict that populations of widespread species that occur in the southern Amazon will be locally‐adapted to more extreme and/or prolonged drought conditions. If traits related to drought tolerance (e.g., water use efficiency) are limited to specific genotypes that are currently restricted to populations in the southern Amazon, then the individuals capable of persisting and populating the increasingly drier future Amazonian (Malhi et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0049">2009</a>) will likely originate from southern populations.
