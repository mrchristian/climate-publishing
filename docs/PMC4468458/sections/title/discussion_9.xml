 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This systematic review assessed the relationship of climate change to some pregnancy outcomes. Different studies have measured effects of these changes on eclampsia, preeclampsia, cataract, LBW, PTB, hypertension, sex ratio, and length of pregnancy. In general, review of studies suggested harmful effects of the climate and temperature changes on human health. It must be noted that two temperature spectrums either cold or hot influenced health. In some studies, cold weather and in other hot weather were associated with health outcomes. About cataract, the hot weather and 5Â° increase in the temperature were associated with a cataract occurrence. In the study of Catalano 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., cold weather was associated with an increase in the sex ratio and life duration of male sex in 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> year. Cold weather might produce these effects through different mechanisms including direct thermal effects, nutritional shortage and higher exposure to internal contaminants. Dadvand 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. studied hot weather or thermal stress and pregnancy length, they found that exposure to thermal stress was associated with 5 days decrease in the average pregnancy age. Secretion of oxytoxin and heat-shock proteins in results of heat stress is increased; it is recognized as one of the factors related to PTB.[

  <a rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref23">23</a>] One of the other possible reasons of this consequence related to thermal exposure might be because of dehydration.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exposure to cold weather and birth in winter and fall that is, cold seasons, is reported to be associated with LBW and very LBW. PTB is found to be associated with two spectrums of weather extent (cold and hot). Exposure to cold weather, cold storm and high heat has been related to PTB. Increase in hydrosols, viscosity, blood vessel and blood cholesterol have been stated as possible factors.[

  <a rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref26">26</a>] This relationship has been more frequent in mothers with younger age, black race, and Asian background. It is documented that hypertension, eclampsia, and preeclampsia were more frequent in cold weather; cold seasons with more wind and rain. In addition, fertilization in the summer might increase the chance of developing preeclampsia. In addition, increased sunlight intensity has been associated with a decrease in blood pressure. Factors like the effects of Vitamin D, increase in temperature, ultraviolet light, and seasonal infections are mentioned as possible factors.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diverse studies have been conducted about effects of different aspects of climate change including the temperature, season, rain and wind on human health and their results have documented different adverse health effects of climate change on human health. The findings of the current review confirm the crucial importance of the harmful effects of climate changes in the perinatal period.</p>
