  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The search process was conducted in electronic databases including papers published until June 2014 in ISI Web of knowledge, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using key words of “environmental temperature,” “pregnancy,” “LBW,” “pregnancy outcome,” “climate change,” “PTB,” and a combination of them. To extract related articles in PubMed, medical subject heading was used. We considered cross-sectional, case-control, and longitudinal studies. Editorials, commentaries, and letter to editor papers were not included. The search was refined to the English language; we did not consider any time limitation. For any additional pertinent studies, the reference list of all relevant papers was screened as well.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Titles and abstracts of papers were screened, and relevant papers were selected. Duplicates were removed. Then, full texts of relevant papers were read, and findings were rescreened. Two independent (PP and MK) reviewers screened titles and abstracts of papers identified by the literature searches for their potential relevance or assessed the full text for inclusion in the review. In the case of disagreement, and the discrepancy was resolved in consultation with a third arbitrating investigator (RK).</p>

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data extraction and abstraction</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two reviewers abstracted the data independently. The required information that was extracted from all eligible papers was as follows: Data on first author's last name, year of publication and country of the study population, the study name, study design characteristics, study population, type of study, aim and finding of studies.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Articles were excluded after reviewing their abstracts, and finally 15 articles[
