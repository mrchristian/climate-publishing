Different studies were conducted around the world including Asia, Europe, and America; most of them were from America and Europe. The studies were performed according to different methods and principles. Effects of the temperature, different seasons of fertilization time, season of childbirth, humidity and month of childbirth were assessed in these studies. Many diverse measurable outcomes were considered, e.g., eclampsia, preeclampsia, cataract, LBW, PTB, hypertension, sex ratio and length of pregnancy. Approximately all studies have reported a significant relationship between exposure variable and intended outcome. According to conducted studies, decrease in birth weight is more possible in cold months and winter. Increase in temperature was followed by increase in PTB rate. PTB was higher in exposure of the January to February months compared to March to October months.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of selecting primary studies for the systematic review</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-20-397-g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of studies on the effects of climate change on birth outcomes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-20-397-g002"/></table-wrap><p>Studies had presented different results about eclampsia and preeclampsia; however, according to most of the studies, they were more prevalent in cold and humid seasons.

Different studies have measured effects of these changes on eclampsia, preeclampsia, cataract, LBW, PTB, hypertension, sex ratio, and length of pregnancy. In general, review of studies suggested harmful effects of the climate and temperature changes on human health. It must be noted that two temperature spectrums either cold or hot influenced health. In some studies, cold weather and in other hot weather were associated with health outcomes. About cataract, the hot weather and 5&#x000b0; increase in the temperature were associated with a cataract occurrence. In the study of Catalano <italic>et al</italic>., cold weather was associated with an increase in the sex ratio and life duration of male sex in 1<sup>st</sup> year. Cold weather might produce these effects through different mechanisms including direct thermal effects, nutritional shortage and higher exposure to internal contaminants. Dadvand <italic>et al</italic>. studied hot weather or thermal stress and pregnancy length, they found that exposure to thermal stress was associated with 5 days decrease in the average pregnancy age. Secretion of oxytoxin and heat-shock proteins in results of heat stress is increased; it is recognized as one of the factors related to PTB.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] One of the other possible reasons of this consequence related to thermal exposure might be because of dehydration.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Exposure to cold weather and birth in winter and fall that is, cold seasons, is reported to be associated with LBW and very LBW. PTB is found to be associated with two spectrums of weather extent (cold and hot). Exposure to cold weather, cold storm and high heat has been related to PTB. Increase in hydrosols, viscosity, blood vessel and blood cholesterol have been stated as possible factors.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] This relationship has been more frequent in mothers with younger age, black race, and Asian background. It is documented that hypertension, eclampsia, and preeclampsia were more frequent in cold weather; cold seasons with more wind and rain. In addition, fertilization in the summer might increase the chance of developing preeclampsia. In addition, increased sunlight intensity has been associated with a decrease in blood pressure. Factors like the effects of Vitamin D, increase in temperature, ultraviolet light, and seasonal infections are mentioned as possible factors.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Increasing number of studies related to weather and temperature changes highlights the importance of these changes in human health especially on mothers and infants.</p><p>Above review included some limitations such as lack of homogeneity between studies, different methodologies, different sample size and variations in the studied populations.</p><p>Diverse studies have been conducted about effects of different aspects of climate change including the temperature, season, rain and wind on human health and their results have documented different adverse health effects of climate change on human health. The findings of the current review confirm the crucial importance of the harmful effects of climate changes in the perinatal period.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>All authors contributed in the study design, conducting the systematic review, and drafting the manuscript.
