  <span class="italic">N</span> = 3321, 416, 1086, and 257 for Sand, Spit, Eastern, and Laysan, respectively. Wave height and length increase with sea-level rise due to reduced wave breaking and hydrodynamic roughness relative to water depth. The increases in wave height and wavelength result in much greater run-up at higher sea levels.
