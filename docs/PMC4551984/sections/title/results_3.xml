 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Findings from both the field and laboratory experiments revealed a strong relationship between elevated water temperature during the summer months and 
  <span class="italic">P. lividus</span> mortality. In both years, survival rate in the field cages decreased with the seasonal SST rise during the summer (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>, maximum temperature 30.5 °C in 2011, and 31.11 °C in 2012), and stopped almost entirely when SST dropped during the autumn (seen in the 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> experimental period only). In the first experiment, survival rate was reduced to 50% by the end of August 2011, before restocking. In the second year, the survival rate reduced to 78% by the end of July 2012 (after temperature crossed the 30.5 °C threshold and just before the termination of the experiment—prior to peak summer water temperatures).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the laboratory experiment, survival rate decreased sharply with the rise in water temperature, in the ambient and ambient +2 °C treatments (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). In the heated treatment, all urchins died within three weeks. In the ambient treatment, mortality continued as long the temperature was above 30.5 °C (maximum water temperature was 31.5 °C) and ceased almost entirely when ambient temperature reduced below this value. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed a significant difference (P &lt; 0.0001) between the survival rates in the different temperature regimes. WSR was 0.97 in the ambient –2 °C treatment (final survival rate, 70 ± 6.5%), 0.89 in the ambient treatment (final survival rate, 22 ± 2.1%) and 0.63 in the ambient +2 treatment (final survival rate, 0).
