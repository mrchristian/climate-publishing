  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predicted trends from 2006 to 2100 in the eight variables used here are plotted in Fig. S1. As expected, pH decreases and SST increases throughout the world's oceans. The Arctic experiences the most rapid decrease in pH due to the retreat of sea ice which increases absorption of atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> (McNeil &amp; Matear, 
   <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0021">2007</a>). Strongest warming trends occur in the Northwest Pacific and in the tropics, with slower warming in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean, coinciding with regions of deep water formation. Thermocline oxygen content declines almost everywhere due to warming‐related decreases in the solubility of gases and reduced ventilation. The exception is in the equatorial regions which are currently low oxygen zones. Here, it seems that the decrease in exported organic carbon (and hence presumably decreased remineralization) outweighs the expected decline in oxygen content due to warming (Deutsch 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
   <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0006">2014</a>). Surface nitrate concentration decreases almost everywhere, as may be expected from reduced mixing. The exception is at the edges of the oligotrophic gyres, a pattern which appears only in the IPSL family of models and may be driven by decreased biomass of nanoplankton due to increased grazing pressure (Laufkötter 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
   <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0019">2015</a>). PP, nondiatom PP and export all have similar patterns, with decreasing trends throughout low latitudes likely due to increased stratification, and increasing trends in the Southern Ocean and Arctic, which are particularly pronounced in currently ice‐covered regions. Interestingly, chlorophyll shows the same patterns as PP except in the Arctic where chlorophyll decreases but PP increases. This is accompanied by a very strong increasing trend in nondiatom PP which suggests that diatoms are replaced by smaller phytoplankton with a lower chlorophyll : carbon ratio.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For a trend to be rapidly detectable, the ratio of the signal (i.e. the trend magnitude) to the noise (i.e. the variability) needs to be high. The number of years of data needed to detect a trend (
   <span class="italic">n*</span>) in biogeochemical variables is shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="gcb13152-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb13152-fig-0001">1</a>. The natural variability, here defined as the standard deviation of the residuals (see 
   <a rid="gcb13152-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" href="#gcb13152-sec-0002">Materials and methods</a>), is presented in Fig. S2. In many variables, 
   <span class="italic">n*</span> is shorter at low than at high latitudes. This arises because at low latitudes trends are strong but variability tends to be smaller than at high latitudes, and therefore fewer years of data are needed to detect a long‐term trend. An example of how the noise and signal interact in estimating 
   <span class="italic">n*</span> can be found in the Northeast Pacific oxygen content, where low noise and a strong decreasing trend result in an estimated ~25 years of data needed to detect a trend. A scenario at the other extreme is nitrate concentration in the Southern Ocean which has weak noise, but also a weak trend, resulting in larger 
   <span class="italic">n*</span> (&gt;40 years).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate change‐driven trends in pH and SST are most rapidly distinguished from natural variability, requiring just 13.9 and 15.5 years of data, respectively (global median values; Table 
   <a rid="gcb13152-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#gcb13152-tbl-0001">1</a>). Strong trends in response to anthropogenic forcing and, in the case of pH, low natural variability result in rapidly detectable trends, in particular in low latitude regions. For SST, between 20 and 50 years of data are needed to detect a trend in the Southern Ocean and high latitude North Atlantic where warming trends are smallest.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aside from SST and pH, all other biogeochemical variables require, as a global average, 26–33 years of data to detect a trend (Table 
   <a rid="gcb13152-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#gcb13152-tbl-0001">1</a>). Of these, trends in oxygen are most rapidly detectable, particularly in the North Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean (15–20 years) where strong decreasing trends in oxygen content are predicted (Fig. S1). Nitrate, chlorophyll, PP, nondiatom PP and export all have a minimum in 
   <span class="italic">n*</span> (&lt;20 years) in the equatorial Atlantic and Benguela region. Trends in nitrate and both total and nondiatom PP are also rapidly detectable (
   <span class="italic">n*</span> &lt; 25 years) in the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean, at approximately the latitude of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strong decreasing trends in nitrate and chlorophyll in the Atlantic and east Pacific sectors of the Arctic result in rapidly detectable trends (
   <span class="italic">n*</span> &lt; 25 years). Nevertheless, PP, nondiatom PP and export all have strong increasing trends, although this doesn't necessarily result in shorter 
   <span class="italic">n*</span> due to high natural variability (Fig. S2) in these regions.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an indication of the overall rapidity with which climate change trends may be detectable in a range of parameters, the median

   <a rid="gcb13152-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb13152-fig-0002">2</a>. The regions where detecting trends requires the shortest time series of observations (&lt;20 years) are the equatorial Atlantic and Benguela upwelling, in which all variables have relatively short

   <a rid="gcb13152-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb13152-fig-0001">1</a>) due to strong trends and weak natural variability. With 25 years of data, trends are detectable in large parts of the Indian Ocean, particularly the Arabian Sea, and parts of the South and North Pacific gyres, plus a band at 40°S. Long time series of data (&gt;40 years) are needed to detect trends in parts of the Southern Ocean, Northeast Pacific, South Atlantic gyre and northern North Atlantic. In the case of the North Atlantic (Irminger Basin), all variables except pH require very long time series to detect a trend. For the other regions, 
   <span class="italic">n*</span> is long in all variables except pH, SST and oxygen.

At other stations, considerably longer time series would be needed to distinguish a climate change trend, for example at BATS (ranging from ~11 years for SST, ~47 years for export flux, to undetectable in a 95 year record for PP) or the Southern Ocean Time Series station off Tasmania (from ~20 years in SST to ~46 years in chlorophyll, to undetectable in export flux).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean observing stations are typically single point locations, although in some cases arrays of sampling may be carried out, such as the CALCOFI (southern California) grid covered by regular cruises. Here, we assess whether the current network of ocean observing stations provides adequate coverage of ocean conditions to determine a climate change trend. The spatial area wherein each observing station is statistically similar, in terms of its mean and variability, with surrounding conditions (see 
   <a rid="gcb13152-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" href="#gcb13152-sec-0002">Materials and methods</a>) provides an indication of each station's ‘footprint’, that is where single‐point observing stations may be considered representative of conditions in a larger area.

   <span class="sup">6</span> km
   <span class="sup">2</span> on average. Stations in the Arabian Sea, North Pacific and Southern Ocean are representative of the largest areas (e.g. ~4.85 × 10

Oxygen concentration has the smallest footprint, with only 9% of the ocean covered by existing BGC‐SOs. For all variables, any region not in close proximity to a BGC‐SO is unrepresented, mainly in the Southern Hemisphere and Arctic.
