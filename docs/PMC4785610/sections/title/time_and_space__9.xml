 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis presented here quantifies the time and space scales over which biogeochemical observations need to be made to detect climate change trends, and makes a preliminary assessment of whether the current BGC‐SO network meets those requirements. In general, SST and pH are most rapidly detectable (
  <span class="italic">n*</span> ~15 years). These variables respond directly to increasing atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration, resulting in strong trends. In addition, natural variability is relatively low in SST and pH, particularly in low latitudes. Note however that pH can be very variable in coastal regions (Duarte 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0009">2013</a>) which are not resolved in these global models.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In keeping with our previous work (Henson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0013">2010</a>), we find that chlorophyll and PP require longer time series to detect trends (
  <span class="italic">n*</span> ~32 years). A key question arising from the earlier work was whether climate change‐driven trends could be more rapidly detectable in other biogeochemical variables. Here, we find that the answer is generally ‘no’ (except for pH), with oxygen and nitrate concentration, export and nondiatom PP all requiring time series &gt;25 years in length (global median; Table 
  <a rid="gcb13152-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#gcb13152-tbl-0001">1</a>). There are however clear regional differences, with the equatorial Atlantic, Benguela and Arabian Sea requiring fewer years of data to distinguish a trend. In contrast, in parts of the Southern Ocean and Northeast Pacific, detecting trends requires very long records and in some cases changes are nondetectable in the 95 year timescale of the simulations used here. These results are in contrast with the hypothesis that ecosystems can ‘integrate’ the environmental conditions that they experience, improving the signal to noise ratio and permitting detection of weak climate change‐driven trends (Taylor 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0025">2002</a>). Instead we find that detection time is shorter for environmental forcing factors than for the ecosystem response.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to our analysis, some BGC‐SOs have been in operation sufficiently long that climate change trends in some variables should be detectable (Table S2). For example, ALOHA was established in 1988 (~27 years ago at the time of writing) and so climate change trends may now be detectable in their records in all parameters except chlorophyll concentration. Indeed, trends have been identified in pH, PP, SST, chlorophyll concentration and nitrate at ALOHA (Saba 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0023">2010</a>; Kim 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0016">2014</a>). The presence of a statistically significant trend in chlorophyll at ALOHA is inconsistent with our estimate of 
  <span class="italic">n*</span>, implying that the observed trend should not yet be ascribed to climate change (or that the modelled 
  <span class="italic">n*</span> is an overestimate, see 
  <a rid="gcb13152-sec-0008" ref-type="sec" href="#gcb13152-sec-0008">Limitations</a> section). Other stations need to be in operation for some years more, for example PAP where, although trends in pH may be detectable after 14 years of operation, other variables require ~25 years of data. With some exceptions, the current network of BGC‐SOs has not been in operation sufficiently long to detect climate change‐driven trends.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An analysis of the SST and pH data collected at BATS illustrates how the 
  <span class="italic">n*</span> estimates presented in Table S2 and Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb13152-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb13152-fig-0001">1</a> can be applied to 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> time series. At BATS, our analysis suggests that ~15 years of data are needed to distinguish a long‐term trend in pH from background variability (Table S2). We split the observed pH time series (Bates 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0001">2012</a> and N. Bates, personal communication) into overlapping 10 and 15 year chunks and tested for trends by applying Eqn 
  <a rid="gcb13152-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula" href="#gcb13152-disp-0001">(1)</a>. Time series as short as 10 years evince statistically significant trends for most periods, however our analysis suggests that, with an estimated 
  <span class="italic">n*</span> of 15 years, it would be ill‐advised to unequivocally attribute the trend in a 10 year time series to climate change. For 15 year time series, all periods show a statistically significant trend which is likely a genuine long‐term trend. For the whole time series of 30 years, the trend is −0.002 units, which is statistically significant at the 95% level. As the length of the complete time series far exceeds the 
  <span class="italic">n*</span> suggested by our analysis, this trend is highly likely to be climate change‐driven.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the SST time series at BATS, we find that 
  <span class="italic">n*</span> is ~11.5 years (Table S2). Splitting the time series into 10 year pieces, a statistically significant trend is found for the period 1987–1996 (but not for other 10 year chunks). Our analysis suggests that this is unlikely to be a long‐term trend as the time series is shorter than the estimated 
  <span class="italic">n*</span>. Indeed, increasing the length of the time series chunks to 11 years yields the result that the trend in the period 1987–1997 is only just statistically significant at the 95% level. Adding another year of data (forming 12 year pieces) results in the trend for the period 1987–1998 becoming nonsignificant. This result matches exactly with our analysis: that any apparent trend in SST in a dataset shorter than 
  <span class="italic">n*</span> (in this case 11.5 years) is unlikely to be due to climate change forcing, but instead is likely to be an artefact associated with natural variability dominating the short time series. For the entire BATS SST time series, there is no statistically significant trend. As the dataset is substantially longer than our estimated 
  <span class="italic">n*</span>, it is likely that if a climate change‐driven trend were present it would be detectable, suggesting that anthropogenic forcing of SST at BATS is not yet distinguishable from natural variability.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Complementary to estimates of the timescales over which observations need to be made is the consideration of the spatial scales required to ensure adequate representation of ocean conditions. Our results demonstrate that the spatial footprint for SST, pH and nitrate is larger than for biogeochemical variables such as PP. As such, the current network of BGC‐SOs are representative of ~15% of the ocean for pH, but only 9% for thermocline oxygen concentration (Table 
  <a rid="gcb13152-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#gcb13152-tbl-0001">1</a>). For some of the variables considered here there are plentiful alternative sources of data, such as satellite‐derived SST and chlorophyll which ensure global‐scale coverage of surface conditions ensuring that data availability is unlikely to limit trend detection. In addition, platforms such as Argo and bio‐Argo floats, gliders and other autonomous vehicles can provide depth‐resolved data on temperature, chlorophyll, oxygen etc. Therefore for these variables, our calculations underestimate the proportion of ocean represented by current observations. However, variables such as carbon export or phytoplankton functional type‐specific PP are currently not routinely derived from autonomous platforms, so that ship‐serviced BGC‐SOs are the primary source of data.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current observing network results in substantial regions of the ocean which are not represented by any BGC‐SO. The Arctic and the majority of the Southern Hemisphere are particularly poorly covered. Some of these areas overlap with regions where trends are likely to be rapidly detectable (Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb13152-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb13152-fig-0002">2</a>b), implying that timely detection of climate change‐driven trends in ocean biogeochemistry may be jeopardized by the sparsity of the observations in these areas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other regions, notably the west coast of the USA, are represented by multiple BGC‐SOs. One may ask therefore whether some stations could be cut without loss of information for climate change detection. However, it should be noted that the global models used here are relatively coarse resolution (1 × 1°). In addition, this analysis focuses only on the requirements for climate change detection, whereas BGC‐SOs serve many other purposes. Spatial variability will occur on scales smaller than the model resolution, which may be relevant for the primary goals of a BGC‐SO. For example in the case of CALCOFI, a primary goal is fisheries assessment, for which higher spatial resolution sampling is likely to be necessary than for climate trend detection.</p>
