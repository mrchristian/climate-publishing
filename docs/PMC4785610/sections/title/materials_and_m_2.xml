The variables used were annual average sea surface temperature (SST), surface pH, surface chlorophyll concentration and surface nitrate concentration, annual integrated PP and nondiatom PP, annual total export flux at 100 m depth, and annual average oxygen concentration averaged over the 200–600 m depth range, which encompasses the main thermocline (Gruber,

  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0003">2013</a>). Nondiatom PP is used here as a proxy for changes in the relative importance of smaller phytoplankton. These variables were chosen as they are routinely measured at ocean observing stations either autonomously (e.g. temperature, chlorophyll, oxygen) or during regular ship servicing (e.g. PP, export). Additionally, this set of variables is available from a sufficient number of different models to incorporate a quantification of model uncertainty in our analysis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The locations of ocean observing stations that include a biogeochemical component were taken from the OceanSites database (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oceansites.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.oceansites.org</span>). Here, we limit our analysis to fixed point observatories that are identified in the OceanSites database as currently operational or planned, and which have a biogeochemical component, although they may not measure all the variables explored here (hereinafter these are referred to as BGC‐SOs).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To approximate the region over which samples collected at an observing station are representative (the ‘footprint’), pixels which have similar mean and variability to the time series at the station are identified. First, the time series at each station from a 100‐year section of the model control run for each variable is linearly correlated against every other pixel in the model domain. Where the linear correlation is statistically significant at the 95% level (i.e. 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05), and where the pixel is within ±2 standard deviations of the time series mean at the station, the pixel is considered to be representative of conditions at that station. Only regions which are positively correlated with the observing station time series, fall within ±2
  <span class="italic">σ</span>, and are contiguous with it are retained for further analysis. In addition, only pixels in which the contiguous patches overlie in at least half of the eight models used here are retained for analysis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the likely realism of the spatial and temporal scales estimated by the model analysis presented here, comparisons to available satellite observations are made. Comparisons of the coefficient of variation and footprint are presented in the Supporting Information. In general, the model‐derived estimates of 
  <span class="italic">n*</span> may be underestimates in specific regions such as the equatorial Pacific for SST and coastal upwelling regions for chlorophyll, as observed variability tends to be larger than modelled variability (see Supporting Information).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, a note on terminology: here we use the term ‘natural variability’ to indicate interannual, decadal, or multidecadal variability forced by oscillatory or transient conditions (e.g. El Niño‐Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation etc.). In contrast, ‘trends’ is used to refer to long‐term (multidecadal or longer) changes driven by persistent anomalous forcing (in this case global climate change).</p>
