 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the SRES I-Business as Usual (BAU) scenario, we assume that Nr emissions and Nr addition will keep the current annual rates of increase. In 2020 and 2050, Nr in China will produce a cooling effect at −314 and −725 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
  <sub>20</sub> basis and a warming effect at 528 and 939 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
  <sub>100</sub> basis (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig. 6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S8</a>). The results indicate that the increase of Nr compounds without any measures will mitigate the climate change on a 20-y basis however aggravate the warming effect on a 100-y basis. On a 100-y basis, the cooling effect of N-induced C sequestration declines significantly, from 86.0 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e in 2005 to 57.3 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e in 2020, then approaches zero in 2050. By contrast, the impact of Nr emissions on climate change becomes more important, increasing from 408 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e in 2005 to 585 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e in 2020 and 939 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e in 2050. The SRES II-improvement scenario is built on the assumption that the N use efficiency of cropland will increase by 20% in 2020 and another 20% in 2050. Compared to the BAU scenario, on a GTP
  <sub>20</sub> basis, the improvement scenario enhances the net cooling effect with 41% and 38% for the years of 2020 and 2050, largely due to the agricultural N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions reduction. The SRES III-abatement scenario is built on the assumption of total quantity control for NO
  <sub>x</sub> in 2020 and an improved NO
  <sub>x</sub> removal rate in 2050, respectively. On a GTP
  <sub>20</sub> basis, the abatement scenario reduces the net cooling effect by 95% and 139% compared to the BAU scenario, ultimately appearing as a net warming effect in 2050. The reduction in NO
  <sub>x</sub> emissions has a strong negative feedback on climate change in the short term, whereas the increase in N use efficiency represents a positive effect on the mitigation of climate warming. Improving agricultural N use efficiency (i.e. N
  <sub>2</sub>O reduction) is the most timely and effective measure for the mitigation of the climate impact of Nr in China. On a GTP
  <sub>100</sub> basis, the improvement and abatement scenarios both reduce the warming effect by 28% and 14% in 2020, respectively; the reduction effects transfer to 35% and 31% in 2050. Hence, reductions in agricultural N
  <sub>2</sub>O and industrial NO
  <sub>x</sub> emissions have a comparatively large mitigation potential in the long term.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The detailed comparisons between SRES and RCP scenarios are showed in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig 6</a>. All RCP scenarios on a GTP
  <sub>20</sub> basis show a net warming effect, in contrary to our improvement scenario. However, the advantage of our improvement scenario diminishes with time. On a GTP
  <sub>100</sub> basis, its warming effect in 2020 (379.4 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e) nearly approaches that of the lowest RCP scenario (RCP2.6, 356.4 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e), or even in 2050 (613.6 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e) surpasses that of the highest RCP scenario (RCP8.5, 499.6 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e). The warming effect of our abatement scenario on a GTP
  <sub>20</sub> basis is lower than that of the RCP8.5 in 2020 and 2050. However, on a GTP
  <sub>100</sub> basis, its warming effect in 2020 (452.3 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e) and in 2050 (646.1 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e) become higher than that of RCP8.5 (423.5 and 499.6 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e in 2020 and 2050, respectively). The comparison results between SRES and RCP indicate that, (i) our reported SRES scenarios reveal the obvious mitigation potential on climate change but only on a short timescale not on a long timescale. (ii) the objectives of our scenarios in 2020 (i.e. realizing the total quantity control for NO
  <sub>x</sub> and improving the N use efficiency with 20%) is well-targeted to the concentration levels of RCP. However, the objectives in 2050 are too cautious to meet the emission under the RCP scenarios. More aggressive target should be made for the year of 2050.
