 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">China is mobilizing the largest anthropogenic Nr in the world due to agricultural, industrial and urban development. The climate effects of different Nr compounds are experiencing either the aggravation or the transformation processes. Based on the understanding of the dynamic of Nr on climate system, the investigation of possible changes and future trends is more meaningful than current status. Therefore, in this section, we analyze the dynamics and development trajectory of each climate forcer related to Chinese Nr, figuring out the key different points of China from other regions. Here, the differences between the SRES and BAU scenarios are defined as mitigation potential; while the differences between the SRES and RCP scenarios (here using RCP6.0) are defined as mitigation pressure. We further discuss the mitigation potential and mitigation pressure of individual N-related climate forcers (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strong GTP and long lifetime of N
  <sub>2</sub>O makes it the largest and most lasting contributor to global warming in China. Agriculture is responsible for about 80% of the climate warming effect of N
  <sub>2</sub>O. The high N fertilizer input and low N use efficiency in China's agricultural fields are responsible for the increasing N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>. Our scenario analysis shows that a larger mitigation potential for climate change could be realized through improving N use efficiency to reduce agricultural N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions. Many approaches can be taken to enhance N use efficiency, for example, systematic crop rotation, wise use of fertilizer, and expanded use of nitrification inhibitors
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>. Although the agricultural activities are the largest contributor, emission of N
  <sub>2</sub>O from chemical industries also shows a large increase potential; and the control options are the most-effective in this sector
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">10</a>. Hence, the all-around measures to reduce N
  <sub>2</sub>O emission from agriculture and industry could lead to the co-benefits of climate mitigation and positive environmental effect through protecting ozone layer.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The realistic trajectory of NO
  <sub>x</sub> reflects a compilation of environmental policies and economic activities
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>. NO
  <sub>x</sub> emissions in many industrialized countries are expected to decrease
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>. For example, the NO
  <sub>x</sub> reductions in Europe in 2010 can be partly attributed to the global economic recession, and partly to the European NO
  <sub>x</sub> emission controls
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>. Due to rapid economic development and the coal-dominated energy consumption structure, however, large increases in NO
  <sub>x</sub> from China have persisted over the past several decades
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>. According to our results, the ozone-CH
  <sub>4</sub> effect of NO
  <sub>x</sub> emissions in China is the largest cooling agency at a short time horizon, but is nearly negligible at a longer time horizon. The ozone-CH
  <sub>4</sub> effect varies greatly across different regions
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. Investigations have shown that the ozone-CH
  <sub>4</sub> effect is more sensitive to ozone precursor changes from tropical regions (e.g. East Asia) than from mid-latitude and high-latitude regions (e.g. Europe and North America)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>. Therefore, control strategies that reduce emissions of ozone precursors in China have a significant impact on the net climate forces from ozone and CH
  <sub>4</sub>. However, if only considering NO
  <sub>x</sub> alone, NO
  <sub>x</sub> emissions exert a negative force from decreased CH
  <sub>4</sub>, which far exceeds the smaller positive force from increased ozone, resulting in a net cooling effect. The scenario of NO
  <sub>x</sub> emissions reduction alone lead to a positive force and a net warming effect from overwhelming increased CH
  <sub>4</sub>, and as a result fails to produce mitigation potential for climate warming. Combined reductions in NO
  <sub>x</sub> and other ozone precursor emissions (such as CO) are beneficial, because they can produce a net cooling effect through the stronger negative force from decreased ozone
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. Hence, in order to obtain co-benefits from reducing radiative forces and mitigating air pollution, simultaneous emission reductions of various ozone precursors at the regional scale are feasible. In addition, the indirect radiative force on climate change by ozone effects on plant production has proved to contribute more to global warming than the direct radiative force of elevated ozone levels
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>. The effect of NO
  <sub>x</sub> on plants is the secondary contributor to climate warming at both timescales. In China, the combined climate effects of current NO
  <sub>x</sub> emissions on ozone-CH
  <sub>4</sub>, aerosol and the ozone-induced C sink were estimated at −336 ± 290 and 98 ± 97 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
  <sub>20</sub> and a GTP
  <sub>100</sub> basis, respectively. From the results of our scenario analysis, the NO
  <sub>x</sub> reduction has a secondary mitigation potential. Therefore, reduction of NO
  <sub>x</sub> in China can provide the co-benefits of climate-change mitigation and air pollution reduction in the long run. In especial, the NO
  <sub>x</sub> emission reduction still exist a large mitigation pressure when comparing with the RCP scenarios. China should confirm the implementation of total NO
  <sub>x</sub> quantity control required by taking policy measures. Meanwhile, continued push to improve the denitration level is an essential measure for mitigating NO
  <sub>x</sub> pollution.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">China is a large agricultural country with an enormous animal population and tremendous N fertilizer consumption. The characteristics of NH
  <sub>3</sub> emissions reflect the intensity of synthetic fertilizer use and unique patterns of animal densities and types in China
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a>. As the human population continues to demonstrate considerable growth, food production and associated NH
  <sub>3</sub> emissions are likely to increase as well
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>. Increased NO
  <sub>x</sub> and NH
  <sub>3</sub> produce radiative effects resulting from sulfate-nitrate aerosol and single-nitrate aerosol, respectively. The cooling effect of NO
  <sub>x</sub> through the direct aerosol effect is larger than NH
  <sub>3</sub> on a 20-y basis, but its depletion rate with time is faster than the rate of NH
  <sub>3</sub>. Global model studies demonstrated that the increasing nitrate aerosol force would counteract the expected decline in the sulfate force by 2010
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>. The future nitrate aerosol loads are projected to depend strongly on the emission strength of NH
  <sub>3</sub>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>. It can be deduced that a larger increase in nitrate aerosols in China will be accompanied by larger increases of NH
  <sub>3</sub>, as opposed to the smaller increases in Europe, the U.S. and Australia
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>. Although the cooling effect of nitrate aerosols is negligible in the long term, the future air pollution from nitrate in the atmosphere can not be ignored.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the net cooling effects of NO
  <sub>x</sub> and NH
  <sub>3</sub> are short-lived and NO
  <sub>x</sub> even plays a warming role on the long timescale. Nonetheless, the multiple environmental problems resulting from NO
  <sub>x</sub> and NH
  <sub>3</sub>, such as air pollution, eutrophication, etc., are more remarkable than the climate impact in China. In this regard, it is important to assess the trade-offs between the environmental and climate effects of the Nr compounds in the future studies.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">China—especially the east region—is one of the global heavy N-deposition areas
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a>. Under the action of N deposition, our results show forest land in China is the single largest C sink, followed by grassland and cropland. The N status of different ecosystems in China can be reflected and further analyzed from the flux factors of CO
  <sub>2</sub> and CH
  <sub>4</sub> in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S6</a>. For example, N is usually found to be a limiting factor in plant growth in grassland ecosystems in China, and it is mostly unintended fertilization that has stimulated plant growth there
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">42</a>; while almost all croplands can be regarded as N-saturated ecosystems due to continual application of chemical N fertilizers
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">43</a>, as a results, the N-induced flux factor of CO
  <sub>2</sub> is only 0.45–1.7 kg CO
  <sub>2</sub>/kg N. Additionally, there have been very different response patterns of forest ecosystems in China depending on the forest type, the N status of the soil, and the level of N deposition. In N-saturated mature tropical forests, high N addition can reduce soil respiration and CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">44</a>, and decrease CH
  <sub>4</sub> uptake rate
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">45</a>. However, in N-limited pine forests, elevated N deposition has no significant effect on soil respiration or CH
  <sub>4</sub> uptake
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">45</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">46</a>. Overall, the N-induced flux factor of CO
  <sub>2</sub> in forest lands in China is 5–27 kg CO
  <sub>2</sub>/kg N, much lower than that of the United States, with 24–65 kg CO
  <sub>2</sub>/kg N
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">7</a>. Throughout the whole of China, the terrestrial system acts as a net C sink due to N deposition. However, the potential for sustaining more terrestrial C storage as a result of atmospheric N deposition is limited
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">47</a>. As the N deposition increases, the net primary productivity induced by per-unit N deposition has leveled off or declined since the 1980s, indicating that part of the deposited N may not be invested to stimulate plant growth, but instead leave the ecosystem by various pathways
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">48</a>. In addition, globally N fertilizer application-induced CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake began to level off in the 1980s whereas N
  <sub>2</sub>O emission continued to grow
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">49</a>. As a result, the climate benefits of the enhanced C sequestration would likely be eliminated due to increased N use
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">50</a>. Finally, fertilized N will show an increasing warming effect in the future. This trend is more obvious in China. Excessive N-fertilization limits C sequestration. The declining rate of manure recycling to fields causes more N discharge into water or emitted into the air
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">51</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">52</a>

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">N saturation in forest land and excessive N fertilization in cropland in China limit the C sequestration capacity. The effect of N enrichment on C sequestration, as a result, has appeared to diminish in recent years. Hence, through the results of our scenario analysis, there is a certain GHG mitigation pressure in C sequestration through improving N management or reduction gaseous Nr emission in China. Efficient forest development and improved field management have shown the large potential of C sequestration in China's forest and cropland
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">55</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">56</a>. Rational N fertilizer application, no-tillage and preferential crop residues management are widely recognized measures for enhancing C sequestration
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">52</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">56</a>. Climate and environmental quality trade-offs and co-benefits, especially if they are applied nationwide in the near term, provide strong additional motivation for reducing N fertilizer use without yield loss in China.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, anthropogenic Nr in China's environmental system has an obvious warming effect on a long timescale. The reductions in agricultural N
  <sub>2</sub>O and industrial NO
  <sub>x</sub> emissions have a comparatively great mitigation potential for climate change in the long term; while a certain mitigation pressure appears in N-induced C sequestration only if realizing the efficient forest development and improved field management. The mitigation pressure of climate warming of anthropogenic Nr is still under great pressure with time. In 2050, more aggressive targets and more powerful measures should be taken to maintain in a specific radiative forcing level.
