 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inputs of Nr into the terrestrial ecosystem are in the forms of N deposition and N fertilization. N addition into ecosystems can alter the physiology of soil microbes and vegetation, and concomitantly alter the balance of biogenic fluxes of GHGs
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>. Our literature analysis results provide an explicit spatial map of N deposition over China (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). N deposition sums to 15.1 Tg N/yr across China, with 3.56, 5.28, 5.68 and 0.57 Tg N deposited into cropland, forest, grassland and wetland, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3b–e</a>). The estimated N deposition is closed to the published inventories of NO
  <sub>x</sub> and NH
  <sub>3</sub> emissions used in our study. Without considering the response of N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions mentioned above, N addition can stimulate terrestrial CO
  <sub>2</sub> assimilation in both natural vegetation and agricultural land; meanwhile, CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions caused by N simulation to some extent offset the benefit of N-induced CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake in terms of climate change
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>. These opposed impacts of Nr enrichment differ markedly depending on the land cover type
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>. The assessed N-induced CO
  <sub>2</sub> and CH
  <sub>4</sub> emission/uptake factors for different ecosystem types of China are summarized in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S6</a>. Our results show that in China forest land has the largest potential for CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake (−27 to −5 kg CO
  <sub>2</sub>-C/kg N), while cropland has the largest potential for CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions (0.01 to 0.03 kg CH
  <sub>4</sub>-C/kg N). Applying the flux factors of CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake and CH
  <sub>4</sub> emission by ecosystem types in China from 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S6</a> to estimate the net C exchange (NCE) due to N deposition, the overall result indicates that the uptake of CO
  <sub>2</sub>-C (27 to 176 Tg C) overwhelmingly surpasses the CH
  <sub>4</sub>-C emissions (0.11 to 0.21 Tg C), resulting in an NCE of 27 to 176 Tg in terrestrial ecosystems during 2000–2005 (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S6</a>). Most regions in China's terrestrial system function as a net C sink; only a minor area in western China is an N-induced C source (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3f</a>). Our results further show that, during 2000–2005, forest land has the largest C sequestration potential, with 31.9 to 136 Tg C as a result of N deposition, followed by grassland (4.5 to 45 Tg N) and cropland (1.8 to 5.6 Tg N). For fertilized cropland, in addition to N deposition, applied N, including chemical and organic fertilizers, was evaluated at 35.7 Tg in 2005
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">8</a>, resulting in a net CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake of 14 to 58 Tg C and CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions of 0.40 to 1.06 Tg C. The NCE of croplands due to N fertilization amounts to 13.6 to 57.0 Tg C.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the whole, N addition has a positive effect on terrestrial C sequestration over the past several years. The C sequestration simulated by both N deposition and fertilization exerts a cooling effect, −50 ± 86 and −86 ± 51 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
  <sub>20</sub> and a GTP
  <sub>100</sub> basis, respectively (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S7</a>). The climate cooling effects of N-induced C sequestration, however, offset only 18% and 35% of the warming effects of N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions from agriculture in terms of GTP
  <sub>20</sub> and GTP
  <sub>100</sub>, respectively. Basically, taking the effects of these three GHG fluxes between air and land into account, Nr enrichment of the terrestrial ecosystem can be recognized as a strong warming agency.
