 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nr can exert a series of effects on GHG fluxes and on climate systems during its cascade flow. We needed to distinguish these “direct” biogeochemical consequences (i.e., radiative forcing) of atmospheric Nr emission from the “indirect” bio-geophysical climate feedbacks of terrestrial N dynamics through terrestrial GHG fluxes
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">47</a>. We considered six climate-driving forcers of Nr (designated as E1–E6 below) and show detailed interpretations in the 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Supplementary Information</a> (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Fig. S1</a>). The common metric GTP is used to reconcile the climate change impacts of diverse climate forcers into the common unit of equivalent CO
  <sub>2</sub> (CO
  <sub>2</sub>e) (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S1</a>) for the inter-comparison of the relative contributions over 20-y and 100-y timescales, respectively.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate forcers E1–E3 refer to climate change impacts through the effects of the atmospheric Nr species (including N
  <sub>2</sub>O, NO
  <sub>x,</sub> and NH
  <sub>3</sub>) on trapping heat or scattering solar energy. So far, there has been no official national inventory of gaseous Nr species for China. The results from many published studies show a certain inconsistency due to the different approaches used. Rather than calculating the Nr emissions inventory, we compiled Nr emissions from the existing regional and global emissions inventories associated with China, including IIASA GAINS, EDGAR v4, RCPs, and MACCity. The data covered total volumes and sectoral structures of Nr emissions within the period 2000–2005 (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S2</a>).We defined the uncertainty (i.e., standard deviation) using the variation ranges of all these inventories. The estimated results are proved to be comparable with the published local studies (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S3</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate forcers E4–E6 refer to climate-change impacts through the feedback of the atmospheric NO
  <sub>x</sub> and terrestrial Nr enrichment (N deposition and N fertilization) on GHG's biogenic fluxes. We collected the monitoring data of N deposition rates from different sites around China mainly covering the period 2000–2005 from the extant studies (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S4</a>). Through the application of ARCGIS 10, an explicit spatial map of N deposition rate around China was developed using the spatial interpolation technique (kriging). The deposition to each land cover type is obtained by overlapping with the nationwide land-use distribution map. In addition, the fertilization of cropland was adopted from the results of Cui 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">8</a>. Because of the greater heterogeneity of global terrestrial ecosystems, we reviewed and aggregated the data for N-induced GHG emission/uptake of China (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S5</a>). N-induced GHG emission/uptake factors were estimated for different ecosystem types (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S6</a>). In this section, we only accounted for the change in CO
  <sub>2</sub> and CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes, except for N
  <sub>2</sub>O, which has been included in the previous atmospheric Nr emission inventory.
