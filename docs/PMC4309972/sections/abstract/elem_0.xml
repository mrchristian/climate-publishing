 <p>China is mobilizing the largest anthropogenic reactive nitrogen (Nr) in the world due to agricultural, industrial and urban development. However, the climate effects related to Nr in China remain largely unclear. Here we comprehensively estimate that the net climate effects of Nr are −100 ± 414 and 322 ± 163 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
  <sub>20</sub> and a GTP
  <sub>100</sub> basis, respectively. Agriculture contributes to warming at 187 ± 108 and 186 ± 56 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e on a 20-y and 100-y basis, respectively, dominated by long-lived nitrous oxide (N
  <sub>2</sub>O) from fertilized soils. On a 20-y basis, industry contributes to cooling at −287 ± 306 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e, largely owing to emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO
  <sub>x</sub>) altering tropospheric ozone, methane and aerosol concentrations. However, these effects are short-lived. The effect of industry converts to warming at 136 ± 107 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e on a 100-y basis, mainly as a result of the reduced carbon (C) sink from the NO
  <sub>x</sub>-induced ozone effect on plant damage. On balance, the warming effects of gaseous Nr are partly offset by the cooling effects of N-induced carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. The large mitigation potentials through reductions in agricultural N
  <sub>2</sub>O and industrial NO
  <sub>x</sub> will accompany by a certain mitigation pressure from limited N-induced C sequestration in the future.
