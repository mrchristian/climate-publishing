 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between beliefs, personal dietary behaviors, and action</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dietitians were divided when asked if animal products are 
  <span class="italic">essential</span> for a healthy diet. Nearly 42% of survey participants either strongly disagreed or disagreed that animal products are essential for a healthy diet, while 8% are unsure. Almost 50% of survey participants either strongly agreed or agreed that animal products are essential for a healthy diet.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, we tested the hypothesis that the variable personal dietary behavior of whether or not vegetarian or whether or not vegan predicts the promotion of diet as a climate change mitigation strategy among registered dietitians. Of note is that more than 10% of survey participants reported being vegetarian, while 2% reported being vegan. Tables 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">4</a> show the analysis of the survey participants that engage in activities that promote diet as a climate change mitigation strategy based on the personal behaviors of being vegetarian or vegan, respectively. The corresponding 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-value for both the chi-square test for independence (0.002) and the Fisher’s exact test (0.007) are exceedingly small, indicating that the results are statistically significant. These data suggest that vegetarian and vegan dietitians are significantly more likely than non-vegetarian and non-vegan dietitians to engage in activities that promote diet as a climate change mitigation strategy.
