 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species distribution information was obtained primarily through the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref073">73</a>]. OBIS data is point occurrence data only, however, the Northeast U.S. Shelf is well represented in OBIS through the inclusion of data from several ecosystem-wide surveys. For some species, information obtained through OBIS was supplemented with information from other sources including stock assessments [

  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref066">66</a>]. Owing to the multiple sources of information used for species distribution, a quantitative match between exposure and distribution was not calculated and experts were allowed to judge spatial overlap individually using the information provided. The uncertainty introduced by expert elicitation is small since the Northeast U.S. Shelf is well sampled and species distributions are relatively well known [
