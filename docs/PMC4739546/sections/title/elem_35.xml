 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf have life history attributes that suggest distribution may change in response to climate change (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g004" href="#pone.0146756.g004">Fig 4</a>). More than 50% of the species exhibit very high or high potential for a change in species distribution. In general, overall climate vulnerability (changes in population productivity) varies inversely to the potential for a change in species distribution: species highly vulnerable to a change in productivity have a lower potential to change distribution and vice versa (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s010" href="#pone.0146756.s010">S8 Supporting Information</a>). However, the certainty potential for distribution change score of almost half the species was &lt;66%; this lower value of certainty compared to overall climate vulnerability results from the lower number of attributes included in the potential for distribution change calculation.

   <p>Potential was calculated using a subset of sensitivity attributes. Colors represent low (green), moderate (yellow), high (orange) and very high (red) potential for a change in distribution. Certainty in score is denoted by text font and text color: very high certainty (&gt;95%, black, bold font), high certainty (90–95%, black, italic font), moderate certainty (66–90%, white or gray, bold font), low certainty (&lt;66%, white or gray, italic font).</p>
