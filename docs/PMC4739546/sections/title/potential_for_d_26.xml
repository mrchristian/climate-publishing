 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">High potential for change in species distribution was defined as highly mobile adults, broadly dispersing early life stages, low habitat specificity, and high temperature sensitivity [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref034">34</a>]. These attributes have some skill in predicting species that can change distribution in response to climate change; increased dispersal capacity and ecological generalism promote changes in distribution [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref074">74</a>]. The potential for a change in species distribution was estimated using these attributes, reversing the scores for Adult Mobility, Early Life Stage Dispersal, and Habitat Specificity, and applying the same logic rule as in the general vulnerability calculation.
