 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species profiles were prepared to summarize the biological and ecological information needed for experts to score the sensitivity attributes. The consolidation of the information was an important step to ensure that all experts were provided with the same baseline information. In general, the Northeast U.S. Shelf is data rich with regards to fish and invertebrate biology and ecology. However, there are species included in this assessment that are considered data-poor and a Data Quality attribute was included to help identify information gaps. Numerous summary documents were available to complete species profiles including stock assessments [

  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref063">63</a>], Essential Fish Habitat source documents [

  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref065">65</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref066">66</a>]. Peer-reviewed literature was also used to complete the profiles for some species when information was not summarized in the documents described above. General guidelines were developed for completing species profiles and approximately 3â€“6 hours were spent on each species profile. One scientist then reviewed all the profiles to ensure consistency in content.
