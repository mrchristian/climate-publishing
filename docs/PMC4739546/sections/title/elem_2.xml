  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g001" href="#pone.0146756.g001">Fig 1</a>). The steps are: 1) scoping and planning the assessment including i) identifying the spatial region, ii) the species to include, iii) the climate variables to include as exposure factors, iv) the biological and ecological traits to include as sensitivity attributes, and v) recruiting experts to participate in the assessment; 2) preparation of materials for the assessment including i) consolidating available information on each species, ii) obtaining information on the future state of exposure factors, and iii) providing the spatial overlap between climate exposure and species distributions in the region; 3) expert scoring of the different components of the assessment including i) climate exposure scoring, ii) sensitivity attribute scoring, iii) quantifying expert certainty in scoring, iv) scoring the directional effect of climate change on a species in the region, and v) scoring the quality of data used in the assessment; and 4) analyses of the scores including i) estimating overall climate vulnerability, ii) estimating the potential for a distribution change using a subset of sensitivity attributes, iii) estimating certainty in overall climate vulnerability, potential for a distribution change, and the directional effect of climate change using bootstrapping; iv) identifying the importance of each exposure factor and sensitivity attribute to the overall climate vulnerability using a leave-one out sensitivity analysis, v) evaluating the results on a functional group basis, and vi) developing species specific narratives that summarize the results for each species.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study area was the Northeast U.S. Shelf, which ranges from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina through the Gulf of Maine (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g002" href="#pone.0146756.g002">Fig 2</a>). The focus was on species that occur in marine waters of the Northeast U.S. Shelf, but a number of these species use freshwater, estuaries, and offshore areas during some portion of their life history [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref046">46</a>]. Thus the study area included freshwater systems, as well as the shelf and oceanic waters.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The focus of the vulnerability assessment was on marine fish and invertebrate species that commonly occur in the Northeast U.S. Shelf, including exploited species (e.g., Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Sea Scallop), protected species (e.g., Atlantic Salmon), and ecologically important species (e.g., Sand Lances). The exploited species included federally and state managed species, as well as species that are not currently managed but are harvested in the region. Federal commercial and recreational landings were evaluated in developing the list of species. Protected fish species were also assessed including fish species listed under the Endangered Species Act [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref047">47</a>] and species considered as Species of Concern by NMFS [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref048">48</a>]. Several ecologically important forage fish species were included based on species identified as forage by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref049">49</a>]. Highly migratory species were generally excluded because much of their life cycle is completed outside the study area. In total, 82 species were included and divided into 6 functional groups: Coastal Fish (n = 14), Diadromous Fish (n = 10), Elasmobranchs (n = 12), Groundfish (n = 19), Benthic Invertebrates (n = 18), and Pelagic Fish and Cephalopods (n = 9) (
    <a rid="pone.0146756.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0146756.t001">Table 1</a>). These functional groups were based in part on phylogeny and in part on habitats occupied.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate Exposure Factors</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exposure is a measure of the projected magnitude of change in the physical environment due to climate [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref023">23</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref029">29</a>]. Exposure factors are those climate variables included in the assessment that could impact a species (e.g., temperature, salinity). The exposure score includes information about the magnitude of the expected climate change, but not in relation to each species’ tolerances, which are often unknown. Exposure factors were chosen based on two criteria. First, factors were chosen on the basis that studies have found an effect on fish and invertebrate species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf. Second, factors were chosen that are likely to be well represented in the current class of global climate models (models are described below) [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref017">17</a>]. Seven factors were selected: ocean surface temperature (upper 10 m), ocean surface salinity (upper 10 m), surface air temperature, precipitation, surface pH (upper 10 m), currents, and sea-level rise. Bottom estimates were not used owing to the low spatial resolution of current climate models and the fact that most of the models used do not resolve the bathymetry of the Northeast U.S. Shelf. Similarly, primary productivity was not used because of the importance of regional-scale oceanography and estuaries, neither of which are resolved in the current ensemble of current global climate models. All factors were equally weighted owing to the limited knowledge regarding the magnitude of effects and species responses to climate. Changes in the mean and variance of ocean temperature, ocean salinity, air temperature, precipitation, and pH were included, whereas only changes in mean sea level and ocean currents were considered resulting in a total of 12 climate exposure factors (
    <a rid="pone.0146756.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0146756.t002">Table 2</a>). Ocean temperature is an important climate factor, which numerous studies have linked to changes in distribution and productivity [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref004">4</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref041">41</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref042">42</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref050">50</a>]. Fewer studies have linked changes in ocean salinity to biological responses, but changes in salinity may increase metabolic costs [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref051">51</a>], reducing resilience to other changes. Salinity also affects stratification, mixing, and thus the timing and magnitude of primary production [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref052">52</a>]. Most climate models are at a scale where water temperatures in estuaries and freshwater areas are not resolved, so air temperature is used as a proxy [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref014">14</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref053">53</a>], as it is directly linked to the temperature in shallow water owing to air-water heat exchange [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref004">4</a>]. Air temperature and surface ocean temperature are likely correlated because of the large-scale of climate induced warming, but the two factors are important and distinct in terms of their impact on the biology of some species (e.g., Atlantic Salmon are exposed to climate impacts both in freshwater and marine habitats). Streamflow is linked to productivity of a number of diadromous species [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref054">54</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref055">55</a>]. Most climate models do not simulate streamflow, rather they have river routing systems that move water among model grid cells. Precipitation is therefore used here as a proxy of the amount of water in streams and rivers. Numerous studies have found an effect of increased dissolved CO
    <sub>2</sub> (ocean acidification) on marine organisms from larval survival in molluscs to olfaction in fish [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref056">56</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref057">57</a>]. Estimates of pH were derived from Earth Systems Models, which simulate the carbon system to varying degrees of complexity. Ocean currents were also used as a factor since most marine organisms have planktonic early life stages that rely on advection for transport to habitats necessary for the continuation of the life cycle [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref058">58</a>]. Small-scale changes in currents cannot be assessed from the current global climate models, but changes in large scale changes can be considered. Sea-level rise threatens a variety of coastal habitats including marshes, seagrass beds, and beaches [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref059">59</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref060">60</a>]. This threat is exacerbated by the large degree of coastal development in the Northeast U.S. Shelf [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref061">61</a>] and the large reliance of fish and invertebrate species on coastal habitats during portions of their life history [

Most experts have experience with species in several functional groups. Two climate experts also participated, providing access and advice regarding the climate exposure factors. Representatives of the New England Fisheries Management Council, Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council and Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office provided input on species at a workshop where the experts met to discuss exposure and sensitivity scoring (see

The consolidation of the information was an important step to ensure that all experts were provided with the same baseline information. In general, the Northeast U.S. Shelf is data rich with regards to fish and invertebrate biology and ecology. However, there are species included in this assessment that are considered data-poor and a Data Quality attribute was included to help identify information gaps. Numerous summary documents were available to complete species profiles including stock assessments [

Peer-reviewed literature was also used to complete the profiles for some species when information was not summarized in the documents described above. General guidelines were developed for completing species profiles and approximately 3–6 hours were spent on each species profile. One scientist then reviewed all the profiles to ensure consistency in content.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate Projections</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For most climate factors included in the assessment, exposure was estimated from an ensemble of global climate models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report 5 (IPCC AR5). As described above, the choice of climate factors to use in this assessment was impacted by the resolution of the models used for projections. The ocean resolution of these models is too course (0.5–1.0° latitude, 1.0–1.5° longitude) to allow mesoscale eddies, sub-mesoscale eddies, fronts, and regional scale bathymetry and circulation [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref067">67</a>]. The Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) was used, which represents a “business-as-usual” scenario assuming little to no stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions by 2100 [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref068">68</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref069">69</a>]. The 2006–2055 period was chosen for projections because this represents the coming decades, which are of more relevance to living marine resource management than the end of the century. The 50 year average focuses the projections on the forced climate change signal, but also includes the multi-decadal variability signal [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref017">17</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref036">36</a>]. The exposures to ocean surface temperature (upper 10 m), surface air temperature, ocean surface salinity (upper 10 m), and precipitation were estimated from an ensemble of 25–35 global climate models. Exposure to ocean acidification was estimated from an ensemble of 11 earth system models. These ensembles were defined as those models available on the Earth System Grid Federation Portal (
    <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/esgf-web-fe/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/esgf-web-fe/</span>) in autumn 2013 that simulated a given parameter over the time period of interest.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using these model outputs, the change in climate conditions in the future relative to the past were expressed in a standard deviate framework (for the mean factors) and an F-test framework (for the variance factors). Maps of these standard deviates and variance ratios were obtained from NOAA’s Ocean Climate Change Web Portal [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref070">70</a>]. Maps of inter-model variability were also obtained to assess the among-model uncertainty. The approach scales projected future change to the past mean state and variability in that state (i.e., the standard deviate of change is used, not the mean change). For example, the exposure resulting from 1°C increase is greater in an ecosystem with a 0.2°C standard deviation in past temperatures compared to a system with a 2°C standard deviation in past temperatures. This construct is based on macroecological principals that indicate niches are broader in areas of more variable environment [

    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref072">72</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exposure to change in currents and sea-level rise was evaluated by a review of the literature. A summary of likely changes in currents was prepared in consultation with oceanographers and climate scientists (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s004" href="#pone.0146756.s004">S2 Supporting Information</a>). Exposure to a change in currents was scored based on a species use or dependence of large-scale currents in the region. For example American Eel is dependent on the Gulf Stream to transport larvae from spawning locations in the Sargasso Sea to the oceanic waters off the Northeast U.S. Shelf. Thus American Eel is exposed to changes in the Gulf Stream. Similarly for Sea-Level Rise, a summary was prepared of the expected rate of change of regional sea level compared to rates of sea level rise that coastal habitats can accommodate (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s005" href="#pone.0146756.s005">S3 Supporting Information</a>). Exposure to sea-level rise was scored based on a species’ reliance on wetland, seagrass, and estuarine habitats.

    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref073">73</a>]. OBIS data is point occurrence data only, however, the Northeast U.S. Shelf is well represented in OBIS through the inclusion of data from several ecosystem-wide surveys.

Owing to the multiple sources of information used for species distribution, a quantitative match between exposure and distribution was not calculated and experts were allowed to judge spatial overlap individually using the information provided. The uncertainty introduced by expert elicitation is small since the Northeast U.S. Shelf is well sampled and species distributions are relatively well known [

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate Exposure</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four scientists scored climate exposure in consultation with a broader group of climate scientists. Prior to scoring, the experts received an overview of the output of the climate model ensembles [
    <a rid="pone.0146756.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref070">70</a>]. Experts then used information on species distribution and the exposure maps of ocean surface temperature, ocean surface salinity, air temperature, and pH to estimate exposure in the Northeast U.S. Shelf ecosystem. The comparisons between species distribution and exposure maps were made visually by each expert independently. This species specific exposure was then converted to a score using pre-defined criteria (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s006" href="#pone.0146756.s006">S4 Supporting Information</a>). Scores for exposure were: low, moderate, high, and very high. If a species was not exposed to a given factor, it was scored as low exposure (e.g., Acadian Redfish is not exposed to changes in precipitation because they live in deep, offshore waters). For sea-level rise and ocean currents, which were not included in the climate model output, the experts reviewed the exposure summaries (

    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s005" href="#pone.0146756.s005">S3 Supporting Information</a>) and then discussed these documents as a group. Species with no exposure to change in currents were scored as low and species with exposure to currents were scored on the basis of the magnitude of change estimated by expert opinion (clarified in

With regard to Sea-Level Rise, species with no reliance on nearshore habitats were scored low and species that use these habitats were scored based on the magnitude of the impacts of sea-level rise estimated by expert opinion (clarified in

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sensitivity Attributes</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourteen experts scored sensitivity attributes. Benthic Invertebrate, Coastal Fish, Pelagic Fish and Cephalopods, Elasmobranchs, and Diadromous Fish group experts scored all the species in their assigned group and a random selection of other species. Owing to the number of Groundfish species, assigned experts scored half the Groundfish species and a random selection of other species. Experts used the species profiles and attribute descriptions (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s003" href="#pone.0146756.s003">S1 Supporting Information</a>) as a common baseline, but were encouraged to bring their expertise and new information to the scoring process.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scoring of both climate exposure and biological sensitivity was completed individually using a 5 tally scoring system. Each expert had 5 tallies to score each exposure factor or sensitivity attribute; they could place all five tallies in the same bin (e.g., low) for attributes or factors with high certainty, or they could spread their tallies across all bins for attributes or factors with less certainty (e.g., low, moderate, high, very high). Once the individual scores were recorded, experts met in person and discussed scores as a group. Experts were given the opportunity to independently change their final scores based on the discussion, however, there was no requirement nor expectation that experts reach consensus. The full results of the expert scoring- number of tallies per scoring bin (low, moderate, high, very high) by species and attribute are provided in

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Directional Effect</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experts were asked to score the directional effect of climate change for each species, giving an overall indication whether impacts are anticipated to be negative, neutral, or positive on the species in the region. For each species, 3 experts scored directional effect. Experts included the functional group experts for each species (n = 2) and the lead author. Each expert was given 4 tallies to score in the 3 bins. The scores were converted to numbers (negative = -1, neutral = 0, positive = 1) and a weighted average was calculated based on the total of 12 tallies. Weighted averages below -0.333 were classified as an overall negative effect, weighted averages between -0.333 and 0.333 were classified as an overall neutral effect, and weighted averages above 0.333 were classified as an overall positive effect. The full results of the expert scoring, number of tallies per scoring bin (Negative, Neutral, Positive) by species are provided in

    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s008" href="#pone.0146756.s008">S6 Supporting Information</a>). Each expert noted their opinion of data quality for each sensitivity attribute or exposure factor for each species. These data quality scores were then averaged across experts and the proportion of data quality scores &lt;2 for each species was calculated; a score of 2 represents limited data available.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Five analyses were conducted on the expert scores of climate exposure, sensitivity attributes, and directional effect. 1) Overall climate vulnerability was calculated from a combination of climate exposure factors and biological sensitivity attributes. 2) Potential for a change in species distribution was calculated using a subset of sensitivity attributes. 3) Bootstrap analyses were used to evaluate the certainty in the overall vulnerability, potential for a change in distribution, and directional effect of climate change. 4) Leave-one-out sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate the effects exposure factors and sensitivity attributes in determining overall vulnerability. 5) Overall climate vulnerability, potential for distribution change, and directional effect of climate change were analyzed by functional groups to identify larger patterns in climate effects.</p>

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimate of Overall Vulnerability</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall climate vulnerability was estimated using a four step process. First, the component scores (low, moderate, high and very high) were assigned a numerical value (1, 2, 3, and 4). Second, an average score for each climate exposure factor and sensitivity attribute was calculated as the weighted-mean of the experts’ tallies. Third, an overall exposure and sensitivity score was calculated from the weighted means using a logic rule (
    <a rid="pone.0146756.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0146756.t003">Table 3</a>). Fourth, an overall climate vulnerability score was calculated by multiplying the overall exposure and sensitivity scores. The product of the two component numeric scores results in a value between 1 and 16. The overall climate vulnerability rank is then classified as follows: 1–3 low, 4–6 moderate, 8–9 high, and 12–16 very high.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bootstrap analysis was used to calculate the certainty of the climate vulnerability scores, potential for change in distribution scores and directional effect scores. Using the climate vulnerability scores as the examples, the scores across all experts for a given exposure factor (n = 20; 4 experts and 5 tallies) or sensitivity attribute (n = 25; 5 experts and 5 tallies) were drawn randomly with replacement. This was repeated 10,000 times for each of the 12 sensitivity attributes and the 12 exposure factors, and the overall vulnerability score was calculated for each iteration. The outcomes of each iteration was recorded and the proportion of these 10,000 repetitions that scored in each overall vulnerability bin was enumerated. A similar bootstrapping analysis was conducted on the potential for a distribution change (n = 25; 5 experts and 5 tallies) and the directional effect scoring (n = 12; 3 experts and 4 tallies).</p>
