 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 82 species were nearly equally split among the different climate vulnerability ranks: very high (~27%), high (~23%), moderate (~24%) and low (~26%) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g003" href="#pone.0146756.g003">Fig 3</a>). Climate exposure scores for all 82 species were high or very high indicating the magnitude of climate change relative to the variability of past conditions is high. Biological sensitivity ranged from low to very high. The certainty in the score of the majority of species exceeded 90% based on the bootstrap analysis (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g003" href="#pone.0146756.g003">Fig 3</a>). Approximately 27% of species had certainty scores between 66–90%. Approximately 12% of species had certainty scores &lt;66%. For certainty scores less than 50%, a majority of bootstrapped climate vulnerability scores were different than the actual score. Species narratives provide species-specific summaries of the results (

Overall climate vulnerability is denoted by color: low (green), moderate (yellow), high (orange), and very high (red). Certainty in score is denoted by text font and text color: very high certainty (&gt;95%, black, bold font), high certainty (90–95%, black, italic font), moderate certainty (66–90%, white or gray, bold font), low certainty (&lt;66%, white or gray, italic font).
