 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bootstrap analysis was used to calculate the certainty of the climate vulnerability scores, potential for change in distribution scores and directional effect scores. Using the climate vulnerability scores as the examples, the scores across all experts for a given exposure factor (n = 20; 4 experts and 5 tallies) or sensitivity attribute (n = 25; 5 experts and 5 tallies) were drawn randomly with replacement. This was repeated 10,000 times for each of the 12 sensitivity attributes and the 12 exposure factors, and the overall vulnerability score was calculated for each iteration. The outcomes of each iteration was recorded and the proportion of these 10,000 repetitions that scored in each overall vulnerability bin was enumerated. A similar bootstrapping analysis was conducted on the potential for a distribution change (n = 25; 5 experts and 5 tallies) and the directional effect scoring (n = 12; 3 experts and 4 tallies).</p>
