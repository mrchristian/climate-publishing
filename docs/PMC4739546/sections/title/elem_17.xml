  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate Exposure</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four scientists scored climate exposure in consultation with a broader group of climate scientists. Prior to scoring, the experts received an overview of the output of the climate model ensembles [
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref070">70</a>]. Experts then used information on species distribution and the exposure maps of ocean surface temperature, ocean surface salinity, air temperature, and pH to estimate exposure in the Northeast U.S. Shelf ecosystem. The comparisons between species distribution and exposure maps were made visually by each expert independently. This species specific exposure was then converted to a score using pre-defined criteria (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s006" href="#pone.0146756.s006">S4 Supporting Information</a>). Scores for exposure were: low, moderate, high, and very high. If a species was not exposed to a given factor, it was scored as low exposure (e.g., Acadian Redfish is not exposed to changes in precipitation because they live in deep, offshore waters). For sea-level rise and ocean currents, which were not included in the climate model output, the experts reviewed the exposure summaries (

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s005" href="#pone.0146756.s005">S3 Supporting Information</a>) and then discussed these documents as a group. Species with no exposure to change in currents were scored as low and species with exposure to currents were scored on the basis of the magnitude of change estimated by expert opinion (clarified in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s004" href="#pone.0146756.s004">S2 Supporting Information</a>). With regard to Sea-Level Rise, species with no reliance on nearshore habitats were scored low and species that use these habitats were scored based on the magnitude of the impacts of sea-level rise estimated by expert opinion (clarified in

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sensitivity Attributes</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourteen experts scored sensitivity attributes. Benthic Invertebrate, Coastal Fish, Pelagic Fish and Cephalopods, Elasmobranchs, and Diadromous Fish group experts scored all the species in their assigned group and a random selection of other species. Owing to the number of Groundfish species, assigned experts scored half the Groundfish species and a random selection of other species. Experts used the species profiles and attribute descriptions (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s003" href="#pone.0146756.s003">S1 Supporting Information</a>) as a common baseline, but were encouraged to bring their expertise and new information to the scoring process.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Expert Certainty</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scoring of both climate exposure and biological sensitivity was completed individually using a 5 tally scoring system. Each expert had 5 tallies to score each exposure factor or sensitivity attribute; they could place all five tallies in the same bin (e.g., low) for attributes or factors with high certainty, or they could spread their tallies across all bins for attributes or factors with less certainty (e.g., low, moderate, high, very high). Once the individual scores were recorded, experts met in person and discussed scores as a group. Experts were given the opportunity to independently change their final scores based on the discussion, however, there was no requirement nor expectation that experts reach consensus. The full results of the expert scoring- number of tallies per scoring bin (low, moderate, high, very high) by species and attribute are provided in

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Directional Effect</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experts were asked to score the directional effect of climate change for each species, giving an overall indication whether impacts are anticipated to be negative, neutral, or positive on the species in the region. For each species, 3 experts scored directional effect. Experts included the functional group experts for each species (n = 2) and the lead author. Each expert was given 4 tallies to score in the 3 bins. The scores were converted to numbers (negative = -1, neutral = 0, positive = 1) and a weighted average was calculated based on the total of 12 tallies. Weighted averages below -0.333 were classified as an overall negative effect, weighted averages between -0.333 and 0.333 were classified as an overall neutral effect, and weighted averages above 0.333 were classified as an overall positive effect. The full results of the expert scoring, number of tallies per scoring bin (Negative, Neutral, Positive) by species are provided in

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data Quality</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experts also assessed the quality of information available for scoring (i.e., data quality, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s008" href="#pone.0146756.s008">S6 Supporting Information</a>). Each expert noted their opinion of data quality for each sensitivity attribute or exposure factor for each species. These data quality scores were then averaged across experts and the proportion of data quality scores &lt;2 for each species was calculated; a score of 2 represents limited data available.
