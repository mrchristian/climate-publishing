  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species profiles were prepared to summarize the biological and ecological information needed for experts to score the sensitivity attributes. The consolidation of the information was an important step to ensure that all experts were provided with the same baseline information. In general, the Northeast U.S. Shelf is data rich with regards to fish and invertebrate biology and ecology. However, there are species included in this assessment that are considered data-poor and a Data Quality attribute was included to help identify information gaps. Numerous summary documents were available to complete species profiles including stock assessments [

   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref064">64</a>], and monographs that describe the biology and ecology of fish and invertebrate species in the region [

   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref066">66</a>]. Peer-reviewed literature was also used to complete the profiles for some species when information was not summarized in the documents described above. General guidelines were developed for completing species profiles and approximately 3–6 hours were spent on each species profile. One scientist then reviewed all the profiles to ensure consistency in content.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate Projections</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For most climate factors included in the assessment, exposure was estimated from an ensemble of global climate models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report 5 (IPCC AR5). As described above, the choice of climate factors to use in this assessment was impacted by the resolution of the models used for projections. The ocean resolution of these models is too course (0.5–1.0° latitude, 1.0–1.5° longitude) to allow mesoscale eddies, sub-mesoscale eddies, fronts, and regional scale bathymetry and circulation [
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref067">67</a>]. The Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) was used, which represents a “business-as-usual” scenario assuming little to no stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions by 2100 [
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref068">68</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref069">69</a>]. The 2006–2055 period was chosen for projections because this represents the coming decades, which are of more relevance to living marine resource management than the end of the century. The 50 year average focuses the projections on the forced climate change signal, but also includes the multi-decadal variability signal [
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref017">17</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref036">36</a>]. The exposures to ocean surface temperature (upper 10 m), surface air temperature, ocean surface salinity (upper 10 m), and precipitation were estimated from an ensemble of 25–35 global climate models. Exposure to ocean acidification was estimated from an ensemble of 11 earth system models. These ensembles were defined as those models available on the Earth System Grid Federation Portal (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/esgf-web-fe/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/esgf-web-fe/</span>) in autumn 2013 that simulated a given parameter over the time period of interest.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using these model outputs, the change in climate conditions in the future relative to the past were expressed in a standard deviate framework (for the mean factors) and an F-test framework (for the variance factors). Maps of these standard deviates and variance ratios were obtained from NOAA’s Ocean Climate Change Web Portal [
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref070">70</a>]. Maps of inter-model variability were also obtained to assess the among-model uncertainty. The approach scales projected future change to the past mean state and variability in that state (i.e., the standard deviate of change is used, not the mean change). For example, the exposure resulting from 1°C increase is greater in an ecosystem with a 0.2°C standard deviation in past temperatures compared to a system with a 2°C standard deviation in past temperatures. This construct is based on macroecological principals that indicate niches are broader in areas of more variable environment [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exposure to change in currents and sea-level rise was evaluated by a review of the literature. A summary of likely changes in currents was prepared in consultation with oceanographers and climate scientists (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s004" href="#pone.0146756.s004">S2 Supporting Information</a>). Exposure to a change in currents was scored based on a species use or dependence of large-scale currents in the region. For example American Eel is dependent on the Gulf Stream to transport larvae from spawning locations in the Sargasso Sea to the oceanic waters off the Northeast U.S. Shelf. Thus American Eel is exposed to changes in the Gulf Stream. Similarly for Sea-Level Rise, a summary was prepared of the expected rate of change of regional sea level compared to rates of sea level rise that coastal habitats can accommodate (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s005" href="#pone.0146756.s005">S3 Supporting Information</a>). Exposure to sea-level rise was scored based on a species’ reliance on wetland, seagrass, and estuarine habitats.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species distributions</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species distribution information was obtained primarily through the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) [
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref073">73</a>]. OBIS data is point occurrence data only, however, the Northeast U.S. Shelf is well represented in OBIS through the inclusion of data from several ecosystem-wide surveys. For some species, information obtained through OBIS was supplemented with information from other sources including stock assessments [
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref062">62</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref063">63</a>], Essential Fish Habitat source documents [
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref064">64</a>], and monographs [
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref046">46</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref065">65</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0146756.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref066">66</a>]. Owing to the multiple sources of information used for species distribution, a quantitative match between exposure and distribution was not calculated and experts were allowed to judge spatial overlap individually using the information provided. The uncertainty introduced by expert elicitation is small since the Northeast U.S. Shelf is well sampled and species distributions are relatively well known [
