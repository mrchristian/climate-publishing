Quantitative approaches have been developed to examine climate impacts on productivity, abundance, and distribution of various marine fish and invertebrate species. However, it is difficult to apply these approaches to large numbers of species owing to the lack of mechanistic understanding sufficient for quantitative analyses, as well as the lack of scientific infrastructure to support these more detailed studies. Vulnerability assessments provide a framework for evaluating climate impacts over a broad range of species with existing information. These methods combine the exposure of a species to a stressor (climate change and decadal variability) and the sensitivity of species to the stressor. These two components are then combined to estimate an overall vulnerability. Quantitative data are used when available, but qualitative information and expert opinion are used when quantitative data is lacking. Here we conduct a climate vulnerability assessment on 82 fish and invertebrate species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf including exploited, forage, and protected species. We define climate vulnerability as the extent to which abundance or productivity of a species in the region could be impacted by climate change and decadal variability. We find that the overall climate vulnerability is high to very high for approximately half the species assessed; diadromous and benthic invertebrate species exhibit the greatest vulnerability. In addition, the majority of species included in the assessment have a high potential for a change in distribution in response to projected changes in climate. Negative effects of climate change are expected for approximately half of the species assessed, but some species are expected to be positively affected (e.g., increase in productivity or move into the region). These results will inform research and management activities related to understanding and adapting marine fisheries management and conservation to climate change and decadal variability.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this project was provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) NMFS Office of Science and Technology, NOAA NMFS Office of Sustainable Fisheries, NOAA OAR Earth System Laboratory, NOAA NMFS Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office, NOAA NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science Center, and the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program.

A classic example is the historical oscillation between Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy populations in the California Current, which occurred before recorded human exploitation began [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More recently, changes in marine species distribution and population productivity have been linked to changes in the climate [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Changes have also been documented in the distribution of fishery landings and potentially the distribution and magnitude of fishing effort [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although fishing remains an important, and in many cases, dominant driver of population abundance, there is now substantial evidence that climate change and decadal variability affect fish and invertebrate populations [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>An increasing number of studies are linking population models to climate models and projecting the effect of future climate change on marine fish and invertebrate species [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These studies develop either a process-based or empirical relationship between climate variables and population parameters. Projections of the climate factor from climate models are then used to force the population model into the future [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In general, these studies show that climate change will continue to impact species and the ecosystem services they provide (e.g., fisheries, forage, [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]) for the foreseeable future (decades to centuries). For many regions, developing a mechanistic model for each species is not possible in the short-term because of the limited personnel and scientific resources, the lack of mechanistic models linking climate to population dynamics, and the large number of managed species. Global and regional species distribution models have been linked to climate projections to project changes in available habitat and resulting distribution shifts [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These studies typically do not focus on providing species-specific information that can be used by regional fisheries managers.</p><p>Trait-based climate change vulnerability assessments provide another method to evaluate the potential risks to species posed by climate change [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In general, vulnerability assessments are a formal approach for identifying and prioritizing the vulnerabilities in a system [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. They often involve expert elicitation to estimate the general sensitivities of species to a stressor. The approach fills the need for broad, transparent, relatively quick evaluation of the vulnerability of multiple species. Vulnerability assessments have been used to evaluate the risk of overfishing for species within given regions [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and are increasingly being used to evaluate the vulnerabilities of marine species to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>There are many forms, but in general, trait-based vulnerability assessments identify: i) environmental variables expected to change that could impact species (termed exposure factors) and ii) sensitivity attributes that predict a species intrinsic resilience to change [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Some vulnerability assessments separate sensitivity into two components: adaptive capacity and sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but we choose to combine adaptive capacity attributes with sensitivity attributes [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Specifically for climate vulnerability, exposure factors include climate variables that have the potential to affect productivity or distribution of a species (or population) in a specific region. For example, temperature is a climate factor that affects species via multiple mechanisms from enzyme reactions to feeding rate to seasonal distribution [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Species sensitivity attributes include biological or ecological variables that predict the vulnerability to climate change. For example, a species with an inherently low maximum per capita population growth rate is more sensitive to changes in climate compared to species with an inherently high maximum per capita population growth rate. The exposure factors and sensitivity attributes are scored for each species based on a pre-defined scoring system. These scores are combined across exposure factors and sensitivity attributes to derive a relative species-specific climate vulnerability score. While these methods have limitations, the framework allows a diverse set of species to be assessed in a relatively short period of time, and provides a foundation for further research and management responses [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Our objective was to conduct a climate vulnerability assessment for fish and invertebrate species in the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (hereafter Northeast U.S. Shelf) using the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Climate Vulnerability Assessment Methodology [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We use climate projections between 2005&#x02013;2055 to evaluate climate change and decadal variability in the 20&#x02013;40 year time frame. Separating anthropogenic climate change from natural decadal variability is difficult [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and although we use climate change throughout most of this paper, it is important to recognize that the signals of both change and variability are included in the projections. We define vulnerability as a change in a species&#x02019; productivity and or abundance associated with a changing climate, including both climate change and decadal climate variability. We also evaluate the potential for a change in distribution and estimate the directional effect (positive or negative) of a changing climate on species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf. This ecosystem supports valuable commercial ($1.6 billion from landings in 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) and recreational ($14.8 billion in total angler expenditures [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]) fisheries. The region is also experiencing relatively rapid climate change [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Numerous studies have linked recent climate change to changes in the region&#x02019;s fish and invertebrate populations, including changes in productivity [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and distribution [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Of the numerous fishery species in the region, climate variables have only been directly incorporated into scientific advice and management in a few cases [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Although this species-by-species approach is necessary, scientists and managers alike need a broad perspective within which to set research priorities and frame management decisions. Our purpose in conducting this vulnerability assessment is to provide such a system-wide perspective for the Northeast U.S. Shelf.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The methods used here, and the development and rationale behind them, are fully described in the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Climate Vulnerability Assessment Methodology [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

The exploited species included federally and state managed species, as well as species that are not currently managed but are harvested in the region. Federal commercial and recreational landings were evaluated in developing the list of species. Protected fish species were also assessed including fish species listed under the Endangered Species Act [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and species considered as Species of Concern by NMFS [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Several ecologically important forage fish species were included based on species identified as forage by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Highly migratory species were generally excluded because much of their life cycle is completed outside the study area. In total, 82 species were included and divided into 6 functional groups: Coastal Fish (n = 14), Diadromous Fish (n = 10), Elasmobranchs (n = 12), Groundfish (n = 19), Benthic Invertebrates (n = 18), and Pelagic Fish and Cephalopods (n = 9) (<xref rid="pone.0146756.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

id="sec006"><title>Climate Exposure Factors</title><p>Exposure is a measure of the projected magnitude of change in the physical environment due to climate [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Exposure factors are those climate variables included in the assessment that could impact a species (e.g., temperature, salinity). The exposure score includes information about the magnitude of the expected climate change, but not in relation to each species&#x02019; tolerances, which are often unknown. Exposure factors were chosen based on two criteria. First, factors were chosen on the basis that studies have found an effect on fish and invertebrate species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf. Second, factors were chosen that are likely to be well represented in the current class of global climate models (models are described below) [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Seven factors were selected: ocean surface temperature (upper 10 m), ocean surface salinity (upper 10 m), surface air temperature, precipitation, surface pH (upper 10 m), currents, and sea-level rise. Bottom estimates were not used owing to the low spatial resolution of current climate models and the fact that most of the models used do not resolve the bathymetry of the Northeast U.S. Shelf. Similarly, primary productivity was not used because of the importance of regional-scale oceanography and estuaries, neither of which are resolved in the current ensemble of current global climate models. All factors were equally weighted owing to the limited knowledge regarding the magnitude of effects and species responses to climate. Changes in the mean and variance of ocean temperature, ocean salinity, air temperature, precipitation, and pH were included, whereas only changes in mean sea level and ocean currents were considered resulting in a total of 12 climate exposure factors (<xref rid="pone.0146756.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Ocean temperature is an important climate factor, which numerous studies have linked to changes in distribution and productivity [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Fewer studies have linked changes in ocean salinity to biological responses, but changes in salinity may increase metabolic costs [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], reducing resilience to other changes. Salinity also affects stratification, mixing, and thus the timing and magnitude of primary production [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Most climate models are at a scale where water temperatures in estuaries and freshwater areas are not resolved, so air temperature is used as a proxy [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], as it is directly linked to the temperature in shallow water owing to air-water heat exchange [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Air temperature and surface ocean temperature are likely correlated because of the large-scale of climate induced warming, but the two factors are important and distinct in terms of their impact on the biology of some species (e.g., Atlantic Salmon are exposed to climate impacts both in freshwater and marine habitats). Streamflow is linked to productivity of a number of diadromous species [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Most climate models do not simulate streamflow, rather they have river routing systems that move water among model grid cells. Precipitation is therefore used here as a proxy of the amount of water in streams and rivers. Numerous studies have found an effect of increased dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> (ocean acidification) on marine organisms from larval survival in molluscs to olfaction in fish [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Estimates of pH were derived from Earth Systems Models, which simulate the carbon system to varying degrees of complexity. Ocean currents were also used as a factor since most marine organisms have planktonic early life stages that rely on advection for transport to habitats necessary for the continuation of the life cycle [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Small-scale changes in currents cannot be assessed from the current global climate models, but changes in large scale changes can be considered.

The consolidation of the information was an important step to ensure that all experts were provided with the same baseline information. In general, the Northeast U.S. Shelf is data rich with regards to fish and invertebrate biology and ecology. However, there are species included in this assessment that are considered data-poor and a Data Quality attribute was included to help identify information gaps. Numerous summary documents were available to complete species profiles including stock assessments [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], Essential Fish Habitat source documents [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and monographs that describe the biology and ecology of fish and invertebrate species in the region [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Peer-reviewed literature was also used to complete the profiles for some species when information was not summarized in the documents described above.

As described above, the choice of climate factors to use in this assessment was impacted by the resolution of the models used for projections. The ocean resolution of these models is too course (0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x000b0; latitude, 1.0&#x02013;1.5&#x000b0; longitude) to allow mesoscale eddies, sub-mesoscale eddies, fronts, and regional scale bathymetry and circulation [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) was used, which represents a &#x0201c;business-as-usual&#x0201d; scenario assuming little to no stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions by 2100 [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The 2006&#x02013;2055 period was chosen for projections because this represents the coming decades, which are of more relevance to living marine resource management than the end of the century. The 50 year average focuses the projections on the forced climate change signal, but also includes the multi-decadal variability signal [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The exposures to ocean surface temperature (upper 10 m), surface air temperature, ocean surface salinity (upper 10 m), and precipitation were estimated from an ensemble of 25&#x02013;35 global climate models. Exposure to ocean acidification was estimated from an ensemble of 11 earth system models. These ensembles were defined as those models available on the Earth System Grid Federation Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/esgf-web-fe/">http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/esgf-web-fe/</ext-link>) in autumn 2013 that simulated a given parameter over the time period of interest.</p><p>Using these model outputs, the change in climate conditions in the future relative to the past were expressed in a standard deviate framework (for the mean factors) and an F-test framework (for the variance factors). Maps of these standard deviates and variance ratios were obtained from NOAA&#x02019;s Ocean Climate Change Web Portal [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Maps of inter-model variability were also obtained to assess the among-model uncertainty. The approach scales projected future change to the past mean state and variability in that state (i.e., the standard deviate of change is used, not the mean change). For example, the exposure resulting from 1&#x000b0;C increase is greater in an ecosystem with a 0.2&#x000b0;C standard deviation in past temperatures compared to a system with a 2&#x000b0;C standard deviation in past temperatures. This construct is based on macroecological principals that indicate niches are broader in areas of more variable environment [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p><p>Exposure to change in currents and sea-level rise was evaluated by a review of the literature.

Exposure to a change in currents was scored based on a species use or dependence of large-scale currents in the region. For example American Eel is dependent on the Gulf Stream to transport larvae from spawning locations in the Sargasso Sea to the oceanic waters off the Northeast U.S. Shelf. Thus American Eel is exposed to changes in the Gulf Stream. Similarly for Sea-Level Rise, a summary was prepared of the expected rate of change of regional sea level compared to rates of sea level rise that coastal habitats can accommodate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s005">S3 Supporting Information</xref>).

Owing to the multiple sources of information used for species distribution, a quantitative match between exposure and distribution was not calculated and experts were allowed to judge spatial overlap individually using the information provided.

Experts then used information on species distribution and the exposure maps of ocean surface temperature, ocean surface salinity, air temperature, and pH to estimate exposure in the Northeast U.S. Shelf ecosystem.

This species specific exposure was then converted to a score using pre-defined criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s006">S4 Supporting Information</xref>). Scores for exposure were: low, moderate, high, and very high. If a species was not exposed to a given factor, it was scored as low exposure (e.g., Acadian Redfish is not exposed to changes in precipitation because they live in deep, offshore waters). For sea-level rise and ocean currents, which were not included in the climate model output, the experts reviewed the exposure summaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s004">S2 Supporting Information</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s005">S3 Supporting Information</xref>) and then discussed these documents as a group.

Climate vulnerability here is defined as the extent to which abundance or productivity of a species could be impacted by climate change. This vulnerability results from the relatively large magnitude of climate change projected for the region over the next 35 years (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s011">S9 Supporting Information</xref>), as well as attributes of individual species. Changes in population productivity have already been observed in the system [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and the results presented here suggest that these changes are likely to continue in the future, possibly becoming widespread among species in the ecosystem. The results of this assessment also suggest a large number of species in the ecosystem have a high potential for a change in distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Distribution changes have already been observed in the system [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and have been linked to climate variables and fishing [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Finally, this assessment suggests that approximately half of the species included will be affected negatively by climate impacts in the region (e.g., decreased productivity, distribution shifts out of the system). However, positive effects of climate change are expected for some fish and invertebrate species in the ecosystem.</p><p>Ocean temperatures, shallow-water temperatures, and ocean acidification were the climate exposure factors with the largest magnitude of change expected by 2055, thereby contributing most to the high and very high climate exposure. There is more known about the impacts of temperature than the impacts of ocean acidification on the species in the NE LME and continued research on the effects of these factors should be a priority. The effects of temperature on species biology and ecology are well documented and there are numerous examples of incorporating temperature into models of population abundance and distribution [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. These climate induced changes can result in changing reference points for management [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and changes in stock distribution, which can also influence management [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Given the temperature changes experienced in recent decades and projected for the future in the region [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], temperature should be included in regional scientific advice and management. Further, research must continue to understand the mechanisms by which temperature affects species and to parameterize these affects for inclusion in population and ecosystem models [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].</p><p>The effects of ocean acidification on species biology and ecology are not as well understood [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In recent years, a number of studies have started to fill this gap for species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. However, it is often difficult to place the impacts identified in experimental studies into the context of the magnitude of projected change. In the Northeast U.S. Shelf, pH is projected to decrease by 0.08 to 0.12 units by 2055 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s011">S9 Supporting Information</xref>). Many of the studies however use treatments equivalent to ocean acidification conditions expected by 2100 or 2200. In addition, many studies use constant ocean acidification levels, but there is a large magnitude of daily, seasonal, interannual, and regional variability [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Research is needed that tests the impacts of ocean acidification at the levels expected over the next 20&#x02013;40 years to support shorter term projections that can be used in management. One example is a recent study with Atlantic Sea Scallop where fishery yields are projected to decrease in the coming decades owing to the effects of ocean acidification [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Because a meta-analysis shows consistent negative impacts of ocean acidification on mollusc larvae [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] this methodology scored molluscs as very sensitive to ocean acidification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s003">S1 Supporting Information</xref>). As these species also exhibit low adult mobility, molluscs were ranked with a high or very high vulnerability to climate change. This should be interpreted cautiously, and highlights the need for more research on species specific impacts of ocean acidification. It is imperative to experimentally examine the effect of ocean acidification on exploited species, incorporate this information into future climate vulnerability assessments, and include these effects in assessment models that evaluate the impact of acidification in the coming decades.</p><p>In contrast to the high influence of a limited number of exposure factors, the importance of biological sensitivity attributes was more variable; indicating the diversities in life history strategies among fish and invertebrates species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf. In general, Stock Status, Population Growth Rate, and Adult Mobility were the most influential attributes. Improved understanding of these attributes is identified as priority research areas. There are a number of other species specific needs that are identified in the species narratives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s009">S7 Supporting Information</xref>). There is also a need to understand the relative role of climate change in concert with multiple other stressors in affecting population abundance. Here we focused on changing climate but included fishery status and other stressors as sensitivity attributes; stress from climate change will act in concert with other stressors. Including multiple stressors as exposure factors is possible in the vulnerability assessment framework [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; for management to result in long-term sustainability, the important stressors need to be identified and included in management considerations [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Fishing is still a dominant factor, but as fishing mortality decreases, the relative importance of other stressors (e.g., climate change, habitat alterations) will increase [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. New contaminant and disease concerns are being identified and require more study to understand their effect on fish and shellfish populations [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In addition, although barriers to diadromous fish passage are decreasing, a number of barriers remain [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].</p><p>For this study, adaptive capacity was incorporated into the sensitivity attributes. Adaptive capacity includes a species ability to move when conditions change (adult dispersal), ability to acclimate to changes (plasticity in response, generalist versus specialist), and the ability to evolve as a population or species [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. This methodology incorporated aspects of the first two, but not the third; the genetic ability to adapt to climate change remains under-known [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Understanding genotypic and phenotypic adaptive capacity in marine fish and invertebrates should be a priority for future research.</p><p>The results from this assessment can be compared with detailed studies examining past changes in fish and invertebrate species and projecting future changes. In some cases, these more detailed studies seemingly contradict the results presented here. Population productivity of both the Southern New England Yellowtail Flounder and Winter Flounder stocks has decreased and these decreases have been attributed to changes in the environment [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In this climate vulnerability assessment, Yellowtail Flounder was ranked as having a low vulnerability to change in population productivity and Winter Flounder was ranked as having a very high vulnerability to changes in productivity. Similarly, Alewife and American Shad have exhibited some of the greatest shifts in distribution in the ecosystem [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], but the potential for a change in species distribution was low. The results of an expert-based assessment are never going to completely agree with the results of more detailed, empirical and process-oriented studies or assessments. However, expert opinion summarizes current knowledge in a defined framework and can guide future monitoring, research, and modeling studies. Further, the studies described above are not directly comparable with the results of this assessment. The changes in productivity were demonstrated for specific stocks of Yellowtail Flounder and Winter Flounder, those at the southern extent of the range, while this assessment was conducted at the species level encompassing two or three stocks. The directional effect measure estimates negative effects on both Yellowtail Flounder and Winter Flounder. Similarly, the distribution changes in Alewife and American Shad have been observed during the marine phase only. Natal homing is an important part of the life history of these species [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], so changes in spawning distribution are less likely to occur as predicted by this methodology. The important accomplishment of this assessment is to frame climate vulnerability for a majority of managed fish and invertebrate species in the ecosystem and for a number of unmanaged, but ecologically or commercially important species in the ecosystem.</p><p>The assessment was done at the species level. There are pros and cons associated with running a vulnerability assessment at finer (i.e. stock) and coarser (i.e. functional group) levels. A previous assessment in the region was performed at the functional group level [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and management in many cases is at the stock level (sub-species) [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The analysis by functional group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g008">Fig 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s012">S10 Supporting Information</xref>) suggests that while &#x0201c;indicator&#x0201d; species or general functional groups can be used, similar species can have different biological attributes and different overall climate vulnerabilities. A stock specific assessment would be more appropriate to fisheries management, but only in cases where regional species vulnerability is different from stock-specific vulnerability. The choice of number of species (or stocks or functional groups) is dependent on the resources available and the objectives of the assessment.</p><p>Our objective here was to provide a broad examination of climate vulnerability for fish and invertebrates on the Northeast U.S. shelf. There are other approaches to estimating species&#x02019; vulnerability to climate change. For example, thermal habitat modeling was completed to estimate available future thermal habitat on the Scotian Shelf [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. While objectives were similar, the methodologies are different enough that the results provide answers to different questions (projected available habitat vs trait based vulnerabilities). Mechanistic climate-population models are another way of investigating climate vulnerability. Models have been developed for a few species (&#x0003c;10 species) but to complete such detailed analyses for the 82 species included here will take several years at least [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Finally, Bioclimatic Envelop Modeling has been conducted at the global [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and regional scale [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. All of these approaches have value and can contribute to informing managers of the challenges and opportunities that result from climate change. Together, these studies indicate that climate change is going to impact fish and invertebrate species for the foreseeable future.</p><p>In addition to addressing scientific questions and identifying important research needs, the results of this assessment can be used by managers in at least four ways. First, the information resulting from the assessment can be used to inform management and regulatory documents, including fishery management plans developed under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, Biological Opinions, and Listing Decisions under the Endangered Species Act, and Environmental Impact Statements under the National Environmental Policy Act [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Second, the results can be used to guide management actions. The climate vulnerability of 8 species decreases if Stock Status is removed from the analysis: Atlantic Halibut, Winter Flounder, Witch Flounder, Barndoor Skate, Dusky Shark, Porbeagle, Rossette Skate, Sand Tiger, and Thorny Skate. Efforts to decrease fishing mortality on these species might result in an increase in stock size and thus lower overall climate vulnerability. Third, the assessment can contribute to the development of regional Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], inform spatial management (e.g., management areas for future refuges of vulnerable species), and guide the inclusion of climate variables in single-, multi-species and ecosystem models [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Fourth, the vulnerability narratives are useful for identification of species specific research and management needs as they provide in-depth species specific scores as well as a discussion of earlier climate related studies on that species.</p><p>We advocate that the Fisheries Climate Vulnerability Assessment should be conducted iteratively. Most fishery stock assessments are conducted iteratively [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] and we recommend conducting the climate vulnerability assessments following the same interval as the IPCC Assessment Reports. Similarly, Integrated Ecosystem Assessments are planned to be iterative [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The implementation of the Climate Vulnerability Assessment Methodology was successful (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s013">S11 Supporting Information</xref>). However, there are improvements that should be considered for the next iteration. First, bottom temperature and improved ocean acidification projections should be included; both of these would require some form of regional downscaling [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] or higher resolution climate models [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Second, the ensemble uncertainty in climate change could also be included formally in the assessment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s014">S12 Supporting Information</xref>), along with different emission scenarios and potentially time periods. Third, the next iteration should include an update of the species profiles and rescoring of both the climate exposure and sensitivity attributes. If information on species specific plasticity or evolutionary adaptability exist by the next iteration, this information should be included to improve the evaluation of adaptive capacity [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Fourth, the next assessment should include experts from a broader background than used here. This assessment included only NMFS employees with some outside observers. One of the main objectives of this effort was to provide the first implementation of NMFS Methodology [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This will not be an objective of the next iteration and efforts should be made to include a broad array of fisheries, protected species, and ecosystem stakeholders. Fifth, there are potential links that could be made between Overfishing Vulnerability Assessments [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], Habitat Vulnerability Assessments [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] and Social Vulnerability Assessments [<xref rid="pone.0146756.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The vulnerability assessment framework provides a powerful tool that can complement other assessment techniques and support the broader implementation of Ecosystem-Based Management and climate change adaptation strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec034"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"
