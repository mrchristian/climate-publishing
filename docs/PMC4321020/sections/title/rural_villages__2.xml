 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change and population growth may not always impact the timing and composition of disease within villages and small cities in the same way. As a village develops into a city there are typically increases in access to healthcare, socio-economic status and disease control efforts. The speed at which a region urbanizes (or rather the length of the transition from rural to developed) can be associated with a potentially decade-long transient period where disease incidence actually increases.

  </span> While chronic diseases associated with pollution may not be as relevant in small cities, poor access to adequate drinking water can still pose a large health risk.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies have found that development of a region has resulted in a decrease in the intra-annual variation in disease occurrence. Frequently this is due to an improvement in healthcare access,

  </span> but it can also be due to a stabilization of disease reservoirs as a response to human-induced land change or irrigation.

  </span> Although individual diseases are still influenced by climatic drivers such as rainfall and temperature, an increase in access to healthcare appears to mute the seasonal signal of disease and disease-related death. While improved access to healthcare is of an obvious benefit to the public, it unfortunately masks the proximal mechanisms driving temporal variation in incidence. As such, to adequately account for the role these drivers and the changing landscape plays on the seasonality of disease-related deaths, even more data is required.
