 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding contemporary seasonal patterns of all disease-induced deaths is vital for adequate public health responses, but so are investigations of individual causes. Unfortunately, many cities' clinics and hospitals are routinely overwhelmed by infectious disease outbreaks (e.g., Dhaka during cholera season), and accurately predicting when resources should be increased (as well as possibly when resources are needed elsewhere) can greatly reduce the number of disease cases that result in death. Additionally, from the standpoint of control, accurately identifying times of the year where the effect of control efforts will be maximizing can greatly reduce mortality.

  </span> Both climate change and urbanization will greatly alter an already poorly understood landscape. As population densities increase, planning could improve the responses of overstretched health systems, but this places greater emphasis on understanding the world today. At present, the necessary data and models with which to provide this information is lacking.
