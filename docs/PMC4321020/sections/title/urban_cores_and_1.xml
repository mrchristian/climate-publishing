 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of the current large urban areas in the tropics are undergoing relatively unchecked growth, with population increases well outpacing improvements in infrastructure. Megacities, such as Dhaka or Jakarta as well as megacities-in-waiting, such as Kinshasa, are overwhelmed with a seemingly unending array of public-health threats.

  </span> Pollution, a major driver of respiratory-related diseases, will almost surely become a larger problem with further urbanization and increasing temperature. Increases in population density combined with warmer climates will increase the number of individuals without reliable access to freshwater

  </span> and will exacerbate projected increases in heat-related deaths.

  </span> Poor sanitary conditions driven by ineffective infrastructure and potential increases in flooding will combine within megacities to drive the incidence of diarrheal diseases like cholera and rotavirus.

  </span> With global climate change projected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events,

   <a rid="TRU194C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#TRU194C2">2</a>
  </span> diarrheal diseases, the leading killer of children under the age of 5 years, will maintain their endemic status and strongly drive patterns of mortality.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chronic diseases such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are constant threats within urban cores that are strongly influenced by increases in temperature.

  </span> Their contribution to disease-induced deaths will likely increase during the hotter months of the year. The seasonality of many infectious diseases are also strongly linked to climatic drivers, but no single climatic driver affects all infectious diseases in the same way. Shigella bacteria favor moderate temperatures, so shigella-related deaths would increase in places that are now colder.

  </span> Conversely, warmer temperatures tend to favor both mosquitoes and the pathogens they transmit, but only up to a point. Though the burden of dengue is increasing, it remains unclear whether this is primarily the result of urbanization or climate change. Malaria, on the other hand, tends to decline with urbanization

  </span> although urban malaria can be a significant health risk in some settings.

   <a rid="TRU194C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#TRU194C3">3</a>
  </span> Co-infection and comorbidity, both of which are a major threat in urban cores, will alter the overall disease-related death rates in ways that are difficult to predict and likely not universal across all large cities within the tropics.
