  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arctic temperatures are rising and are projected to further increase in the future, resulting in earlier spring thaws and ice melts 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Intergovernmental1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Intergovernmental1">[36]</a>. This likely will result in earlier invertebrate hatches because arctic invertebrate emergence is temperature dependent 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Sweeney1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Sweeney1">[86]</a>. Long–term field observations and recent experimental warming studies of arctic plots support this hypothesis

   <a rid="pone.0108899-Tulp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Tulp1">[88]</a>. If birds are unable to alter migration timing, then arctic nesting shorebirds may have insufficient food resources for young.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(ES2) Migration food resources</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some migrants depend on highly seasonal food sources during migration 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Castro1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Castro1">[89]</a>. For example, shorebirds such as Ruddy Turnstones, Red Knots, Sanderlings, and Semipalmated Sandpipers are highly reliant on American Horseshoe Crab (
   <span class="italic">Limulus polyphemus</span>) eggs for refueling during northward migration stopovers

   <a rid="pone.0108899-Mizrahi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Mizrahi1">[91]</a>. If climate change affects timing of horseshoe crab breeding, this would disrupt synchronicity between horseshoe crab egg laying and spring migration.
