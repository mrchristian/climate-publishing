 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We accepted that the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will approximately double (over pre–industrial levels) by the middle to the end of the century

  <a rid="pone.0108899-Chapin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Chapin1">[37]</a>. We then summarized, based on current understanding reported in the literature, the effects climatic change should have on habitats used by our focal shorebirds in the western hemisphere. What follows is our assessment of these changes (designated B1–B5), and brief statements about our confidence in these changes. These approximate confidence levels of &gt;70%, 30–70%, and &lt;30% are modified from the 5–category scale developed by 
  <a rid="pone.0108899-Moss1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Moss1">[38]</a> for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report. We reduced the number of categories because we did not think the implied precision of 5 levels of confidence was defensible.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tundra habitat will be reduced in extent as the tree line moves poleward; areas that persist as tundra will become less dominated by graminoids and other low–growth species and will become increasingly dominated by more shrubby species, reducing the habitat value for breeding shorebirds 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Keeling1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Keeling1">[39]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Raynolds1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Raynolds1">[47]</a>. Also, the boreal forest will extend its range northward as it replaces tundra, but its southern distribution will contract northwards 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Chapin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Chapin1">[37]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Karl1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Karl1">[44]</a>. Although it is true that new areas of bare ground are likely to be created by ice cap and glacial recession in high tundra areas, we do not believe that this will result in more habitat for most breeding shorebirds since it will persist as gravel or bouldery moraine for a long period until vegetated and soil–forming processes can occur. Confidence = medium.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are also likely, but the aggregate effects on tundra hydrology are difficult to predict 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Martin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Martin1">[48]</a>. Drier overall conditions may be likely, and may reduce food availability during the breeding season 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Martin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Martin1">[48]</a>. It is unclear how climate change will affect the water balance on tundra breeding habitats due to the complex interaction of several factors, including amounts and timing of precipitation events, timing and extent of spring thaw, depth of the active layer, and erosion events 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Martin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Martin1">[48]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Woo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Woo1">[53]</a>. While annual rainfall is predicted to increase throughout the breeding range, evapotranspiration is also expected to increase enough to more than offset the effect of increased precipitation 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Intergovernmental1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Intergovernmental1">[36]</a>. The result may be a loss of some wetland breeding habitat to dryer conditions, but this is unclear. Confidence = medium.

   <a rid="pone.0108899-Mcleod1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Mcleod1">[60]</a> we assume that sea levels will rise globally by between 1 and 2 meters, resulting in the loss of coastal shorebird habitats. This applies to North, Central and South America 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Menon1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Menon1">[61]</a>, and will be worst in areas with, for example, high tidal amplitudes in shallow lagoons and broad estuaries

   <a rid="pone.0108899-Strauss1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Strauss1">[65]</a>. Consequently, we anticipate major loss of coastal wintering habitat for shorebirds, particularly in areas where the land surface is subsiding or accretion rates of intertidal habitats are low (e.g., most Gulf Coast sites)

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecological modeling based on climate change models indicates that increased aridification in South America will have the following effects: first it is likely to result in the replacement of currently forested areas in the Amazon by savanna habitat and seasonal forests

   <a rid="pone.0108899-Malhi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Malhi1">[71]</a>. Experimental droughts in the eastern Brazilian Amazon resulted in increased tree mortality, which also supports the expectation of declining rainforest habitat 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-LoladaCosta1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-LoladaCosta1">[72]</a>. This is unlikely to benefit shorebirds as few use the existing savanna habitats in central South America. Second, the existing grassland areas in central and southern South America will become drier

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The only North American shorebird species that primarily uses temperate forest habitat for breeding is the American Woodcock. The species prefers young forest with openings, and the species tolerates a wide a range of tree species 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Keppie1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Keppie1">[74]</a>. In much of the woodcock's range afforestation is occurring due to ecological succession resulting from abandonment of historical agricultural areas 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Flinn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Flinn1">[75]</a>. As a result, young forests adjacent to fields or containing areas of open habitat are declining, resulting in loss of required breeding habitat. Additionally, climate change likely will result in increased vegetation growth at higher latitudes in North America 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Moss1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Moss1">[38]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Lucht1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Lucht1">[41]</a>. This will result in the establishment of more woody vegetation and a subsequent increase in young forest habitat in the north. It is unclear if northward expansion of the woodcock's range is occurring, so changes in forest landscape may outpace range expansion. Another potential concern for forest breeding habitat is climate change's impact on tree mortality. There is growing evidence that drought resulting from climate change leads to increased tree mortality

   <a rid="pone.0108899-Jactel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Jactel1">[78]</a>. This may open breeding areas for American Woodcock locally, but widespread forest loss could result in loss of breeding habitat. Confidence = Medium.
