 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tundra habitat will be reduced in extent as the tree line moves poleward; areas that persist as tundra will become less dominated by graminoids and other low–growth species and will become increasingly dominated by more shrubby species, reducing the habitat value for breeding shorebirds

  <a rid="pone.0108899-Raynolds1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Raynolds1">[47]</a>. Also, the boreal forest will extend its range northward as it replaces tundra, but its southern distribution will contract northwards

  <a rid="pone.0108899-Karl1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Karl1">[44]</a>. Although it is true that new areas of bare ground are likely to be created by ice cap and glacial recession in high tundra areas, we do not believe that this will result in more habitat for most breeding shorebirds since it will persist as gravel or bouldery moraine for a long period until vegetated and soil–forming processes can occur. Confidence = medium.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are also likely, but the aggregate effects on tundra hydrology are difficult to predict 
  <a rid="pone.0108899-Martin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Martin1">[48]</a>. Drier overall conditions may be likely, and may reduce food availability during the breeding season 
  <a rid="pone.0108899-Martin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Martin1">[48]</a>. It is unclear how climate change will affect the water balance on tundra breeding habitats due to the complex interaction of several factors, including amounts and timing of precipitation events, timing and extent of spring thaw, depth of the active layer, and erosion events 
  <a rid="pone.0108899-Martin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Martin1">[48]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0108899-Woo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Woo1">[53]</a>. While annual rainfall is predicted to increase throughout the breeding range, evapotranspiration is also expected to increase enough to more than offset the effect of increased precipitation 
  <a rid="pone.0108899-Intergovernmental1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Intergovernmental1">[36]</a>. The result may be a loss of some wetland breeding habitat to dryer conditions, but this is unclear. Confidence = medium.
