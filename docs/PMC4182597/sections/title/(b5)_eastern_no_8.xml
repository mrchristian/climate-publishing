 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The only North American shorebird species that primarily uses temperate forest habitat for breeding is the American Woodcock. The species prefers young forest with openings, and the species tolerates a wide a range of tree species 
  <a rid="pone.0108899-Keppie1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Keppie1">[74]</a>. In much of the woodcock's range afforestation is occurring due to ecological succession resulting from abandonment of historical agricultural areas 
  <a rid="pone.0108899-Flinn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Flinn1">[75]</a>. As a result, young forests adjacent to fields or containing areas of open habitat are declining, resulting in loss of required breeding habitat. Additionally, climate change likely will result in increased vegetation growth at higher latitudes in North America

  <a rid="pone.0108899-Lucht1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Lucht1">[41]</a>. This will result in the establishment of more woody vegetation and a subsequent increase in young forest habitat in the north. It is unclear if northward expansion of the woodcock's range is occurring, so changes in forest landscape may outpace range expansion. Another potential concern for forest breeding habitat is climate change's impact on tree mortality. There is growing evidence that drought resulting from climate change leads to increased tree mortality

  <a rid="pone.0108899-Jactel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Jactel1">[78]</a>. This may open breeding areas for American Woodcock locally, but widespread forest loss could result in loss of breeding habitat. Confidence = Medium.
