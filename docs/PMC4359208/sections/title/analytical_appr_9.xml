 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the studyâ€™s hypotheses. Structural equation models are a versatile class of models for characterizing multivariate relationships. The general SEM combines factor analysis and regression models to allow structural relationships among latent variables (

Specifically, these models contain relationships among latent variables that represent trust in agricultural and environmental interests, belief in and attribution of climate change, perceived climate risks, and support for action. Model 1 investigates support for adaptive action, and Model 2 investigates support for mitigative action.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variables used in the analysis all consist of ordered response categories. Since traditional SEM methodology incorporates covariance structures assuming continuous responses, we modify the SEM approach to appropriately account for the discrete but ordered nature of the data (

Briefly, the approach links the observed responses to unobserved continuous variables through an ordinal probit model, and these continuous variables then form a SEM. This allows for efficient estimation, which we accomplish through Bayesian analysis. Further model and estimation details can be found in the online appendix (at

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two models are developed to test the hypothesized relationships between trust, beliefs, perceived risks, and support for climate change adaptation and mitigation responses. Both models examine hypotheses H1a and H1b through a structural regression of beliefs about climate change on trust in agricultural and environmental interests as sources of information about climate change. In addition each model includes a structural path from beliefs about climate change to perceived risks to test H2. The response variable for Model 1 is support for adaptation (H3). The dependent variable for Model 2 is support for mitigative action (H4).</p>
