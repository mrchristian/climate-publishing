 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perceived risk has been a central focus of research on response to climate change. Risk perception corresponds to beliefs about “adverse consequences for valued objects” (AC) and is central to the VBN framework (

Risk perception has generally been measured as an individual’s assessment of the potential health, economic, and general environmental consequences of climate change at local, regional, and global levels (

Results of empirical research examining the relationships between perceived risk and public responses to climate change have been consistent in terms of significance and predictive power. Whether the dependent variable is mitigation policy preferences (

The few studies that have included measures of “objective” risk (e.g.,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although findings have been consistent, it is important to take into account that perceptions of risk from climate change may vary with understanding and knowledge of the phenomenon. Perceived risk is an affect heuristic, based on experiential learning and emotional response to external stimulus (

The tendency toward associative and affective processes and reliance on mediated information creates vulnerability to competing climate change frames put forth by interest groups (
