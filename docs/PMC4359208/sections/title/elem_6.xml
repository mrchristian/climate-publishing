  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study focuses on farmers in the state of Iowa, the top U.S. producer of corn and soybean (

Climate change-related shifts in long-term weather patterns predicted for the state include warmer winters, longer growing seasons, higher dew point temperatures, higher annual stream flow, and more frequent extreme weather events (

While changes such as a longer growing season may be favorable to Iowa agriculture, others could lead to negative impacts such as increased soil erosion, delays in planting or crop damage, higher incidence of pests and disease, and heat-induced pollination problems (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agriculture also emits a disproportionately high percentage of Iowa’s overall GHGs relative to other states. Whereas agriculture directly generates about 7% of US GHGs through activities such as enteric fermentation in ruminant livestock, manure management, and use of nitrogen fertilizers (
   <a rid="bibr72-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr72-0013916513503832">USEPA, 2013</a>, p. 6-1), in 2011, direct emissions of GHGs from agriculture comprised 26% of Iowa’s overall GHG emissions (

   <a rid="bibr36-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr36-0013916513503832">IDNR, 2012</a>, p. 5). These activities primarily generate the potent GHGs CH
   <sub>4</sub> and N
   <sub>2</sub>O, which have “global warming potentials” 21 and 310 times that of CO
   <sub>2</sub>, respectively (
   <a rid="bibr25-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr25-0013916513503832">Forster et al., 2007</a>, p. 212). Thus, Iowa also provides an appropriate context for examining farmer attitudes toward mitigation action.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data for this research were collected through the 2011 Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll (IFRLP), an annual statewide survey of Iowa farmers conducted by Iowa State University Sociology Extension. Iowa Agricultural Statistics administers the survey following a survey–postcard–survey mailing protocol. The 2011 survey was mailed to 2,030 farmers in February 2011. Useable surveys were received from 1,276 farmers, for a response rate of 63%.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A note regarding the sample is warranted. The original survey panel was a random sample drawn from the Census of Agriculture master list, and the survey panel is periodically refreshed with random samples from this list to address attrition due to retirement and other factors. Because the IFRLP focuses so heavily on agricultural activities, many smaller-scale “farmers” who are sampled because they could potentially produce US$1,000 in sales (the USDA definition of farm), but do not actually farm, choose not to participate because the surveys do not apply to them. A comparison of 2011 IFRLP and 2007 Census of Agriculture statistics shows that this process has led to an IFRLP sample bias toward larger scale farmers. IFRLP farmers operated an average of 402 ac in 2011, compared with 331 ac among the 2007 census population. A comparison of farm sales finds that 15.2% of IFRLP farmers had 2011 gross farm sales of less than $10,000, compared with 38.6% of the 2007 Census population. At the other end of the sales spectrum, 48.2% of IFRLP farmers had 2011 sales greater than $100,000, compared with 35.6% for the 2007 census population (
   <a rid="bibr70-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr70-0013916513503832">USDA NASS, 2009</a>). While this bias toward larger scale farmers might be seen as a liability for some research efforts, for this study it is considered an asset because larger scale farms operate a disproportionate amount of acreage. For example, whereas only 39% of Iowa farms generate $100,000 or more in gross sales, they operate 83% of farmland acreage (
   <a rid="bibr70-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr70-0013916513503832">USDA NASS, 2009</a>). Thus, our findings regarding attitudes toward adaptation and mitigation activities are biased toward farmers who generate a larger proportion of Iowa’s agricultural production and farm operations that are reflective of mainstream, conventional agricultural systems in the Upper Midwest.

   <span class="italic">Support for adaptive and mitigative responses to climate change</span> was measured through three items, measured on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (
   <span class="italic">strongly disagree</span>) to 5 (
   <span class="italic">strongly agree</span>), gauging the degree to which participants support specific adaptation and mitigation actions. Two items focused on adaptation responses specific to a major predicted impact of climate change on Iowa agriculture: increased incidence of precipitation (
   <a rid="bibr34-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr34-0013916513503832">ICCIC, 2011</a>). The first item, “Iowa farmers should take additional steps to protect their land from increased precipitation,” focuses on protection of agricultural land from increases in rainfall. Extreme rain events in 2008 and 2010 resulted in significant, widespread erosion across Iowa (
   <a rid="bibr16-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr16-0013916513503832">Cox, Hug, &amp; Bruzelius, 2011</a>), raising awareness of the issue and a potential need to act. The second adaptation statement, “Iowa farmers should increase investment in agricultural drainage systems (tile, ditches) to prepare for increased precipitation,” is particularly salient for Iowa farmers given the hydrological history and current profile of Iowa’s most productive agricultural lands. Artificial drainage of Iowa’s humid prairie, the soils of which contain extraordinary amounts of organic matter (
   <a rid="bibr52-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr52-0013916513503832">Mutel, 2007</a>), facilitated cultivation of these highly fertile soils and made Iowa a leading agricultural state (
   <a rid="bibr60-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr60-0013916513503832">Peterson &amp; Englehorn, 1946</a>;

Drainage represents a longstanding engineered solution to the problem of “excess” water in Iowa, and a logical adaptive strategy for maintaining productivity in the face of future increases in precipitation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mitigation item, “Government should do more to reduce the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions and other potential causes of climate change,” is a general statement that measures farmer support for public action to address the anthropogenic causes of climate change. It reflects the fact that mitigation is generally initiated by government bodies (
   <a rid="bibr40-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr40-0013916513503832">Klein et al., 2007</a>) and that major proposals for mitigation action in agriculture are government-led (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the study’s hypotheses. Structural equation models are a versatile class of models for characterizing multivariate relationships. The general SEM combines factor analysis and regression models to allow structural relationships among latent variables (
   <a rid="bibr10-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr10-0013916513503832">Bollen, 1989</a>). We construct two multivariate models that draw on SEM techniques. Specifically, these models contain relationships among latent variables that represent trust in agricultural and environmental interests, belief in and attribution of climate change, perceived climate risks, and support for action. Model 1 investigates support for adaptive action, and Model 2 investigates support for mitigative action.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variables used in the analysis all consist of ordered response categories. Since traditional SEM methodology incorporates covariance structures assuming continuous responses, we modify the SEM approach to appropriately account for the discrete but ordered nature of the data (
   <a rid="bibr39-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr39-0013916513503832">Kim, Das, Chen, &amp; Warren, 2009</a>). Briefly, the approach links the observed responses to unobserved continuous variables through an ordinal probit model, and these continuous variables then form a SEM. This allows for efficient estimation, which we accomplish through Bayesian analysis. Further model and estimation details can be found in the online appendix (at

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two models are developed to test the hypothesized relationships between trust, beliefs, perceived risks, and support for climate change adaptation and mitigation responses. Both models examine hypotheses H1a and H1b through a structural regression of beliefs about climate change on trust in agricultural and environmental interests as sources of information about climate change. In addition each model includes a structural path from beliefs about climate change to perceived risks to test H2. The response variable for Model 1 is support for adaptation (H3). The dependent variable for Model 2 is support for mitigative action (H4).</p>
