 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that Iowa farmers largely endorse adaptive action focused on preparing for more extreme weather events. However, attitudes toward adaptation action were associated with beliefs and perceived risks; farmers who believed that climate change is occurring 
  <span class="italic">and</span> perceived threats specific to farming were significantly more likely to support action to protect land from future extreme weather. In other words, our findings suggest that it is when farmers believe in climate change and perceive it as a “problem” that their willingness to take action is activated. These results also point to potentially important pathways for climate change outreach to farmers. Farming requires more constant adaptation to weather and other biophysical contextual conditions than most occupations, thus farmers are by necessity professional problem solvers (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extreme weather events that have impacted Midwest agriculture (

For example, a recent report from the 25×’25 Alliance Adaptation Workgroup, a collaboration among major agriculture, forestry, and environmental organizations, highlights the vulnerabilities that recent extreme events have exposed in dominant cropping systems and calls for major adaptation action in agriculture (

This signals an increasing openness to action on climate change among major agricultural actors. Our results showing substantial farmer support for adaptation action, considered together with evidence that mainstream agricultural organizations are beginning to address the need for climate adaptation, point to opportunities to engage farmers and those agricultural actors through the lens of adaptation.
