  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p> . . . will farmers . . . respond more to climate-change messages from universities and USDA, or to those from [other interest groups]? Will they interpret problematic weather as evidence of long-term climate change, and accept that they must learn to adapt, or dismiss it as a “bad year” produced by natural cycles? . . . how can the importance of responding to climate change be conveyed convincingly to farmers? (p. 24)</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study begins to answer these pressing questions, and our findings have practical implications that can inform efforts to improve adaptation and mitigation efforts in Iowa and across the Corn Belt. The findings that trust in agricultural and environmental actors is associated with farmers’ beliefs about climate change, and those variations in belief structure are related to risk perceptions and attitudes toward action point to potential pathways for such outreach. In particular, the divergence of results on farmer attitudes toward adaptation and mitigation actions indicate that different approaches to outreach strategies will be required for these related but distinct responses to climate change.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trust in Key Actors and Climate Change Beliefs</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings on trust have important implications for outreach to farmers and the agricultural community. First, the results imply that Iowa farmers are heterogeneous in terms of whom they trust on climate change. Many farmers expressed trust in environmentally oriented organizations as sources of information about climate change (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916513503832" href="#table1-0013916513503832">Table 1</a>), and those farmers were more likely to believe that climate change is happening and due to human action, that it poses risks to agriculture, and that action should be taken. In other words, such farmers are concerned and open to adaptive and mitigative action.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, farmers who express higher levels of trust in agricultural interests are less likely to believe in climate change, much less anthropogenic causes. These results provide evidence that the “manufacturing of uncertainty” that has played a role in shaping the general public’s beliefs about climate change (
   <a rid="bibr22-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr22-0013916513503832">Dunlap &amp; McCright, 2010</a>) may also be at work in agriculture. As noted above, key agricultural interests have denied a connection between climate change and human activity; this study’s findings suggest that so-called “denial machine” tactics (
   <a rid="bibr21-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr21-0013916513503832">Dunlap, 2010</a>; 
   <a rid="bibr67-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr67-0013916513503832">Stuart et al. 2012</a>) may have an impact on how farmers think about climate change. This result points to challenges and opportunities: If farmers trust farm groups and the agricultural press for information on climate change, it is critical that the climate research and policy community engage more with these groups, especially the farm press. While this might be difficult given the reluctance of some actors to engage in discussion of climate change and potential responses, because these groups may influence farmer beliefs and attitudes, working with them is imperative.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation Approaches</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that Iowa farmers largely endorse adaptive action focused on preparing for more extreme weather events. However, attitudes toward adaptation action were associated with beliefs and perceived risks; farmers who believed that climate change is occurring 
   <span class="italic">and</span> perceived threats specific to farming were significantly more likely to support action to protect land from future extreme weather. In other words, our findings suggest that it is when farmers believe in climate change and perceive it as a “problem” that their willingness to take action is activated. These results also point to potentially important pathways for climate change outreach to farmers. Farming requires more constant adaptation to weather and other biophysical contextual conditions than most occupations, thus farmers are by necessity professional problem solvers (
   <a rid="bibr56-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr56-0013916513503832">Nowak, 2013</a>). Strategies that appeal to farmers’ creative responses to the problem of extreme weather may be effective avenues for outreach focused on adaptation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extreme weather events that have impacted Midwest agriculture (
   <a rid="bibr16-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr16-0013916513503832">Cox et al., 2011</a>) may be helping to move farmers and major agricultural actors toward a problematization of climate change. For example, a recent report from the 25×’25 Alliance Adaptation Workgroup, a collaboration among major agriculture, forestry, and environmental organizations, highlights the vulnerabilities that recent extreme events have exposed in dominant cropping systems and calls for major adaptation action in agriculture (
   <a rid="bibr1-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr1-0013916513503832">25×’25 Adaptation Initiative, 2013</a>). This signals an increasing openness to action on climate change among major agricultural actors. Our results showing substantial farmer support for adaptation action, considered together with evidence that mainstream agricultural organizations are beginning to address the need for climate adaptation, point to opportunities to engage farmers and those agricultural actors through the lens of adaptation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mitigation Approaches</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The findings on mitigation, however, point to a much different dynamic and signal that support for mitigation and adaptation are activated in distinct ways. Whereas support for adaptation seems to be related to the interplay between beliefs and perceived risks to agriculture, support for mitigation appears to be conditionally independent of perceived risks, and is associated primarily with belief that climate change is occurring (and due to human activity). Moreover, only one third of the farmers endorsed the item measuring support for government action on GHGs, and they were almost exclusively those who indicated that climate change is occurring and due to human activity. Consistent with our expectations and norm activation theory (
   <a rid="bibr62-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr62-0013916513503832">Roser-Renouf &amp; Nisbet, 2008</a>; 
   <a rid="bibr66-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr66-0013916513503832">Stern, Dietz, Abel, Guagnano, &amp; Kalof, 1999</a>; 
   <a rid="bibr75-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr75-0013916513503832">Weber &amp; Stern, 2011</a>), it appears that only those farmers who assign blame to humans see value in societal efforts to reduce GHGs.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another important finding was the lack of a statistically significant relationship between perceived risks to agriculture (e.g., “potential impacts on my farm operation”) and support for mitigation. Given that the mitigation variable measured support for government action in a general sense (not specific to agriculture), and that the perceived risk items were specific to agriculture, this result is perhaps not surprising. Whereas adaptive action such as investment in protective conservation practices can have immediate positive impacts at the individual farm level, perhaps neutralizing climate risk, the climate-related impacts of government action on GHGs are diffuse and long-term. Future research might use measures of perceptions of more global, collective risks in addition to local, individual risks to further test variations in scale associated with mitigation.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings suggest that for a majority of farmers, outreach that focuses on mitigation will not likely resonate. Most Iowa farmers do not believe that human actions are responsible for climate change. Furthermore, farmer concerns about potential (local) risks to agriculture were not associated with endorsement of government action on GHGs.</p>
