 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The literature reviewed above indicates that beliefs about climate change and perceptions of associated risks can be important predictors of public support for climate change action. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the mediating influence of actors that attempt to shape the framing and debate over climate change and societal responses should be accounted for in analyses of public understanding of climate change. Based on this previous research, for this study of Iowa farmers, we propose two models that posit pathways of effect-prioritized relationships between trust in agricultural and environmental interest groups as sources of climate change information, beliefs about climate change and its causes, the perceived risks of climate change for agriculture, and support for (1) adaptive or (2) mitigative responses to climate change among Iowa farmers.</p>

   <p>
    <span class="bold">Hypothesis 3 (H3):</span> Higher levels of perceived risk will predict stronger support for adaptation responses to climate change;

   <p>
    <span class="bold">Hypothesis 4 (H4):</span> Belief that climate change is occurring and caused by human activity will have a direct, positive effect on support for mitigation policy.
