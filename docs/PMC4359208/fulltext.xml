Farmers face pressures to adjust agricultural systems to make them more resilient in the face of increasingly variable weather (adaptation) and reduce GHG production (mitigation). This research examines relationships between Iowa farmers&#x02019; trust in environmental or agricultural interest groups as sources of climate information, climate change beliefs, perceived climate risks to agriculture, and support for adaptation and mitigation responses. Results indicate that beliefs varied with trust, and beliefs in turn had a significant direct effect on perceived risks from climate change. Support for adaptation varied with perceived risks, while attitudes toward GHG reduction (mitigation) were associated predominantly with variation in beliefs. Most farmers were supportive of adaptation responses, but few endorsed GHG reduction, suggesting that outreach should focus on interventions that have adaptive and mitigative properties (e.g., reduced tillage, improved fertilizer management).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>agriculture</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>mitigation</kwd><kwd>risk</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Global climate change is widely viewed as one of the most significant challenges facing society today.

Long-term shifts in annual averages and seasonal patterns of precipitation, temperature, and humidity, as well as more erratic and extreme weather events leading to increased risk of floods, drought, and fire are anticipated for the future (<xref rid="bibr14-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Coumou &#x00026; Rahmstorf, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Hatfield et al., 2011</xref>). Predicted impacts on agriculture include redistribution of water availability and compromised quality, increased soil erosion, and decreased crop productivity (<xref rid="bibr32-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Howden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr48-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">McCarl, 2010</xref>), which present immediate and localized economic risks to farmers. In contrast, production of GHGs has effects across the larger landscape that are not readily apparent at short time scales. It is estimated that agriculture contributes between 10% and 15% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions including nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>); (<xref rid="bibr13-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Climate Change Position Statement Working Group, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2007</xref>). Thus, climate-change-related threats to agriculture represent threats to quality of life at local and global scales, and calls for the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies for agriculture are increasing in their urgency (e.g., <xref rid="bibr14-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Coumou &#x00026; Rahmstorf, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Howden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr48-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">McCarl, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Literature on adaptation and mitigation of natural hazards finds that behavioral responses to hazards depend in large part on risk perception, or &#x0201c;beliefs about the existence and characteristics of a natural hazard&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr55-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Nigg &#x00026; Mileti, 2002</xref>, p. 280). In other words, behavior change is influenced by perceptions of the risks associated with a given natural hazard, which are mediated by beliefs about (1) the existence of the hazard and (2) its characteristics. Perceived risk among individuals or collectivities, while a critical determinant of willingness to prepare for or mitigate natural hazards, is often at odds with objective assessments of risk (<xref rid="bibr55-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Nigg &#x00026; Mileti, 2002</xref>). Because perceptions of risk are socially constructed and transmitted, differences in worldviews, personal experiences, expectations about technology, trust in institutions, and other factors can influence awareness and understanding of hazards and decisions and actions (or inaction) in response (<xref rid="bibr63-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Slovic, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Beliefs and risk perceptions regarding climate change are particularly unsettled. Whereas scientific understanding of climate change is firmly established&#x02014;it is occurring, it is due primarily to human activities, and it poses potentially serious risks to human society and natural systems (<xref rid="bibr54-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">NRC, 2010b</xref>)&#x02014;public understanding of the phenomenon varies widely (<xref rid="bibr46-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Maibach, Roser-Renouf, &#x00026; Leiserowitz, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr74-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Weber, 2010</xref>). In recent reviews of research on public understanding of climate change, <xref rid="bibr75-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Weber and Stern (2011)</xref> and others (<xref rid="bibr38-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Kahan, Jenkins-Smith, &#x00026; Braman, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Leiserowitz, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr51-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">McCright &#x00026; Dunlap, 2011b</xref>) highlight a number of factors that explain variance in U.S. public perspectives on the issue. Climate change is difficult for a general public to understand because the causes (GHGs) are invisible and signals and impacts are diffuse and difficult to predict or interpret correctly, especially at local levels and human time scales (<xref rid="bibr29-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Gleick, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr75-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Weber &#x00026; Stern, 2011</xref>). In addition, whereas climate science is based on <italic>analytical processing</italic> of large amounts of carefully collected data, individuals tend to base judgments and decisions on <italic>associative and affective models</italic> of cognition that are evolutionarily older and rooted more in feeling than in scientific facts (<xref rid="bibr47-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Marx &#x00026; Weber, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr63-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Slovic, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr75-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Weber &#x00026; Stern, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, formation of attitudes toward relatively new, emerging attitude objects such as climate change may be more strongly influenced by values and worldviews than by objective data (<xref rid="bibr75-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Weber &#x00026; Stern, 2011</xref>). Finally, because climate change is difficult to understand based on personal experience, the public must rely on indirect sources of information on climate change, which can be manipulated by actors with disparate interests (<xref rid="bibr38-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Kahan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr49-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">McCright &#x00026; Dunlap, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr75-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Weber &#x00026; Stern, 2011</xref>). Moreover, these factors have led to a

Farmers are the group on which the tasks of climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture will mainly fall (<xref rid="bibr9-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Berry, Rounsevell, Harrison, &#x00026; Audsley, 2006</xref>). However, farmer attitudes toward the actions that might be required to adapt agriculture to changes in climate as well as decrease agriculture&#x02019;s GHG emissions are largely unknown. As <xref rid="bibr32-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Howden et al. (2007)</xref> emphasize, if farmers do not believe that climate change is happening or do not perceive it as a threat, they will not likely undertake adaptive or mitigative actions. Given the evidence that belief in and perceived risks from hazards are necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for action, and the predicted threats that climate change poses to sustainable production of food and energy, an improved understanding of farmer beliefs and risk perceptions associated with climate change is urgently needed. In particular, it is critically important to understand what factors shape attitudes toward responses to climate change (<xref rid="bibr21-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Dunlap, 2010</xref>).</p><p>This study examines the complex relationships between farmer beliefs about climate change, risk perceptions, trust in key institutions, and attitudes toward adaptive and mitigative actions. It does so through analysis of data from a state-wide survey of Iowa farmers to answer the following research questions: (1) Do farmers believe that climate change is occurring, and if so, to what do they attribute it?; (2) Does differential trust in agricultural and environmental interest groups influence those beliefs?; (3) Do variations in farmer understanding of climate change influence levels of perceived risk?; (4) Do levels of perceived risk predict support for adaptive and mitigative action?; and, (5) Do predictors of support for adaptive action differ from predictors of support for mitigation? We use structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess the relationships between trust, belief, perceived risk, and support for action.</p><sec id="section1-0013916513503832"><title>Beliefs, Perceived Risk, Trust, and Responses to Climate Change</title><p>Because there is a paucity of literature on farmers&#x02019; understandings of and response to climate change, we draw on the burgeoning body of research that examines the general public&#x02019;s beliefs, attitudes, policy preferences, and behaviors associated with climate change to inform our analysis. Much of this research has built on the &#x0201c;values&#x02013;beliefs&#x02013;norms&#x0201d; (VBN) framework for analyzing relationships between environmental concerns and behavior (e.g., <xref rid="bibr12-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Brody, Grover, &#x00026; Vedlitz, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Dietz, Dan, &#x00026; Shwom, 2007</xref>). The VBN framework was developed primarily by Stern and colleagues (<xref rid="bibr18-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Dietz, Fitzgerald, &#x00026; Shwom, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr65-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Stern, 2000</xref>) to help frame the investigation of relationships between pro-environmental behaviors and key explanatory variables such as personal values, beliefs, attitudes, and norms. The model proposes a causal chain of several categories of variables that together explain a substantial amount of variance in environmentally significant behavior. Loosely described, the categories are personal values; beliefs, including environmental worldviews; understandings of the causes and consequences of environmental problems; personal capacity to address those problems; and personal norms or sense of moral obligation to take action (<xref rid="bibr65-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Stern, 2000</xref>, p. 412).</p><p>The VBN&#x02019;s environmentally oriented synthesis of a number of other behavioral models (e.g., the theory of planned behavior [<xref rid="bibr3-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Ajzen, 1991</xref>]) has proved useful in conceptualizing and analyzing the determinants of pro-environmental behavior (<xref rid="bibr18-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Dietz et al., 2005</xref>). We look to the VBN literature, particularly that which has focused on public response to climate change, as a reference and guide to the development of a conceptual framework specific to our research questions about the relationships between trust in agents of influence, beliefs about climate change, perceived risk, and support for adaptive and mitigative responses in agriculture.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0013916513503832"><title>Beliefs About Climate Change and Support for Action</title><p>Individuals&#x02019; beliefs about the world and their place in it are central to most major behavioral models. The expectancy-value (EV) model (<xref rid="bibr24-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Fishbein, 1963</xref>), the theory of planned behavior (<xref rid="bibr2-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Ajzen, 1985</xref>), and the VBN theory (<xref rid="bibr65-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Stern, 2000</xref>), all posit that beliefs provide the foundation from which attitudes toward objects and actions are formed, and those attitudes can be highly predictive of behaviors. It is critical to recognize, however, that beliefs may not be scientifically based and may vary substantially between individuals and groups. Indeed, &#x0201c;they may be irrational, based on invalid or selective information, be self-serving, or otherwise fail to correspond to reality,&#x0201d; but nevertheless &#x0201c;form the cognitive foundation for many of our responses to aspects of that world&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr4-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Ajzen &#x00026; Gilbert Cote, 2008</xref>, p. 290).

Such studies have provided valuable insight into the role that different dimensions of climate change beliefs may play in shaping responses to climate change. However, variability in the measures used has made synthetic interpretation of results difficult.</p><p>Given that erroneous public understanding of climate change has been proposed as an important roadblock to public action (<xref rid="bibr75-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Weber &#x00026; Stern, 2011</xref>), it may be that inconsistencies in the measurement of public understanding of climate change is a barrier to better understanding of the relationships between beliefs and behavior/policy support. While use of straightforward measures of beliefs about climate change and its causes are common in public polling on the issue (e.g., <xref rid="bibr44-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Leiserowitz, Maibach, &#x00026; Roser-Renouf, 2011</xref>) or used as dependent variables (e.g., <xref rid="bibr50-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">McCright &#x00026; Dunlap, 2011a</xref>), they are rarely used as predictors of policy support or behavior. Thus, most attempts to improve our understanding of the links between beliefs about climate change and behavioral and policy responses have used indirect rather than direct measures of belief and attribution. In other words, measures such as knowledge that N<sub>2</sub>O is a GHG may not be robust proxies for overall beliefs about whether climate change is occurring and what its causes are. As noted above, direct measures of belief and attribution have been used in surveys: It is known that some people strongly believe that climate change is occurring and attribute it to human activity, others do not believe that it is happening, and still others are uncertain (e.g., <xref rid="bibr46-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Maibach et al., 2009</xref>). Such direct measures of climate change belief are not, however, commonly employed as predictors in multivariate modeling of behavior, support for policy, or other social action.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0013916513503832"><title>Perceived Risk</title><p>Perceived risk has been a central focus of research on response to climate change.

Adaptation has always been central to farming, and over millennia farmers have generally been adept at adapting agriculture to a changing environment (<xref rid="bibr59-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2012</xref>). Although farmers manage at multiple scales, their adaptation decisions are primarily driven by private benefits reaped in the here and now (<xref rid="bibr37-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). Examples of adaptation of agriculture to the impacts of climate change might include adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility. In the U.S. Midwest, commonly recommended adaptive actions include increased use of practices such as minimization of tillage and use of cover crops to protect soils from erosion and build soil organic matter (<xref rid="bibr41-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Lal et al., 2011</xref>). Such practices have relatively observable, immediate impacts, such as reduced vulnerability, that accrue largely to the individual farmer or landowner who adopts them (<xref rid="bibr73-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Walthal et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, adaptation strategies are familiar and have tangible individual-level benefits.</p><p>Whereas adaptation has long been integral to agriculture, climate change mitigation is a relatively new attitude object. Mitigation is defined as &#x0201c;technological change and substitution that reduce resource inputs and emissions per unit of output&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr33-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2007</xref>, p. 818). In agriculture, mitigation is focused primarily on reducing GHG emissions and/or increasing carbon sequestration and storage (<xref rid="bibr33-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2007</xref>). In contrast to adaptation action, the potential benefits of mitigation action are uncertain, entail substantial lag time, and accrue globally rather than locally (<xref rid="bibr73-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Walthal et al., 2012</xref>). Because the benefits of mitigative action are diffuse, much of the public discussion related to GHG production and mitigation to reduce emissions has focused on <italic>collective</italic> responses by civil society, private sectors, and, especially, government bodies (<xref rid="bibr77-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">World Bank, 2012</xref>).

Furthermore, the rationale for mitigation in agriculture is almost entirely predicated on the assumption that human production of GHGs is the primary driver of climate change. Thus, while adaptation in agriculture is relatively routine&#x02014;farmers continuously adapt to changing conditions regardless of beliefs about climate change&#x02014;attitudes toward and willingness to support mitigative action are likely influenced largely by beliefs about climate change and the role of human activities as a cause.</p></sec><sec id="section6-0013916513503832"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>The literature reviewed above indicates that beliefs about climate change and perceptions of associated risks can be important predictors of public support for climate change action.

Whereas agriculture directly generates about 7% of US GHGs through activities such as enteric fermentation in ruminant livestock, manure management, and use of nitrogen fertilizers (<xref rid="bibr72-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">USEPA, 2013</xref>, p. 6-1), in 2011, direct emissions of GHGs from agriculture comprised 26% of Iowa&#x02019;s overall GHG emissions (<xref rid="bibr36-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Iowa Department of Natural Resources [IDNR], 2012</xref>, p. 3). Fifty-nine percent of agricultural GHGs stemmed from soil management for grain production and the balance from livestock production and waste (<xref rid="bibr36-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">IDNR, 2012</xref>, p. 5). These activities primarily generate the potent GHGs CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, which have &#x0201c;global warming potentials&#x0201d; 21 and 310 times that of CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively (<xref rid="bibr25-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Forster et al., 2007</xref>, p. 212). Thus, Iowa also provides an appropriate context for examining farmer attitudes toward mitigation action.</p><p>The data for this research were collected through the 2011 Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll (IFRLP), an annual statewide survey of Iowa farmers conducted by Iowa State University Sociology Extension. Iowa Agricultural Statistics administers the survey following a survey&#x02013;postcard&#x02013;survey mailing protocol. The 2011 survey was mailed to 2,030 farmers in February 2011. Useable surveys were received from 1,276 farmers, for a response rate of 63%.</p><p>A note regarding the sample is warranted. The original survey panel was a random sample drawn from the Census of Agriculture master list, and the survey panel is periodically refreshed with random samples from this list to address attrition due to retirement and other factors. Because the IFRLP focuses so heavily on agricultural activities, many smaller-scale &#x0201c;farmers&#x0201d; who are sampled because they could potentially produce US$1,000 in sales (the USDA definition of farm), but do not actually farm, choose not to participate because the surveys do not apply to them. A comparison of 2011 IFRLP and 2007 Census of Agriculture statistics shows that this process has led to an IFRLP sample bias toward larger scale farmers. IFRLP farmers operated an average of 402 ac in 2011, compared with 331 ac among the 2007 census population. A comparison of farm sales finds that 15.2% of IFRLP farmers had 2011 gross farm sales of less than $10,000, compared with 38.6% of the 2007 Census population. At the other end of the sales spectrum, 48.2% of IFRLP farmers had 2011 sales greater than $100,000, compared with 35.6% for the 2007 census population (<xref rid="bibr70-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">USDA NASS, 2009</xref>). While this bias toward larger scale farmers might be seen as a liability for some research efforts, for this study it is considered an asset because larger scale farms operate a disproportionate amount of acreage. For example, whereas only 39% of Iowa farms generate $100,000 or more in gross sales, they operate 83% of farmland acreage (<xref rid="bibr70-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">USDA NASS, 2009</xref>). Thus, our findings regarding attitudes toward adaptation and mitigation activities are biased toward farmers who generate a larger proportion of Iowa&#x02019;s agricultural production and farm operations that are reflective of mainstream, conventional agricultural systems in the Upper Midwest.</p></sec><sec id="section9-0013916513503832"><title>Variables in the Model</title><p><italic>Trust</italic> in institutional actors as sources of climate change information was measured through a five-point construct-specific scale ranging from strongly distrust (1) to strongly trust (5) applied to a number of agencies, organizations, and other groups.

The first item, &#x0201c;Iowa farmers should take additional steps to protect their land from increased precipitation,&#x0201d; focuses on protection of agricultural land from increases in rainfall.

The second adaptation statement, &#x0201c;Iowa farmers should increase investment in agricultural drainage systems (tile, ditches) to prepare for increased precipitation,&#x0201d; is particularly salient for Iowa farmers given the hydrological history and current profile of Iowa&#x02019;s most productive agricultural lands.

Structural equation models are a versatile class of models for characterizing multivariate relationships. The general SEM combines factor analysis and regression models to allow structural relationships among latent variables (<xref rid="bibr10-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Bollen, 1989</xref>). We construct two multivariate models that draw on SEM techniques. Specifically, these models contain relationships among latent variables that represent trust in agricultural and environmental interests, belief in and attribution of climate change, perceived climate risks, and support for action. Model 1 investigates support for adaptive action, and Model 2 investigates support for mitigative action.</p><p>The variables used in the analysis all consist of ordered response categories. Since traditional SEM methodology incorporates covariance structures assuming continuous responses, we modify the SEM approach to appropriately account for the discrete but ordered nature of the data (<xref rid="bibr39-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Kim, Das, Chen, &#x00026; Warren, 2009</xref>). Briefly, the approach links the observed responses to unobserved continuous variables through an ordinal probit model, and these continuous variables then form a SEM. This allows for efficient estimation, which we accomplish through Bayesian analysis.

In addition each model includes a structural path from beliefs about climate change to perceived risks to test H2. The response variable for Model 1 is support for adaptation (H3).

(p. 24)</p></disp-quote></p><p>This study begins to answer these pressing questions, and our findings have practical implications that can inform efforts to improve adaptation and mitigation efforts in Iowa and across the Corn Belt. The findings that trust in agricultural and environmental actors is associated with farmers&#x02019; beliefs about climate change, and those variations in belief structure are related to risk perceptions and attitudes toward action point to potential pathways for such outreach. In particular, the divergence of results on farmer attitudes toward adaptation and mitigation actions indicate that different approaches to outreach strategies will be required for these related but distinct responses to climate change.</p><sec id="section17-0013916513503832"><title>Trust in Key Actors and Climate Change Beliefs</title><p>Our findings on trust have important implications for outreach to farmers and the agricultural community. First, the results imply that Iowa farmers are heterogeneous in terms of whom they trust on climate change. Many farmers expressed trust in environmentally oriented organizations as sources of information about climate change (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916513503832">Table 1</xref>), and those farmers were more likely to believe that climate change is happening and due to human action, that it poses risks to agriculture, and that action should be taken. In other words, such farmers are concerned and open to adaptive and mitigative action.</p><p>On the other hand, farmers who express higher levels of trust in agricultural interests are less likely to believe in climate change, much less anthropogenic causes. These results provide evidence that the &#x0201c;manufacturing of uncertainty&#x0201d; that has played a role in shaping the general public&#x02019;s beliefs about climate change (<xref rid="bibr22-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Dunlap &#x00026; McCright, 2010</xref>) may also be at work in agriculture. As noted above, key agricultural interests have denied a connection between climate change and human activity; this study&#x02019;s findings suggest that so-called &#x0201c;denial machine&#x0201d; tactics (<xref rid="bibr21-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Dunlap, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr67-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Stuart et al. 2012</xref>) may have an impact on how farmers think about climate change. This result points to challenges and opportunities: If farmers trust farm groups and the agricultural press for information on climate change, it is critical that the climate research and policy community engage more with these groups, especially the farm press. While this might be difficult given the reluctance of some actors to engage in discussion of climate change and potential responses, because these groups may influence farmer beliefs and attitudes, working with them is imperative.</p></sec><sec id="section18-0013916513503832"><title>Adaptation Approaches</title><p>Our results show that Iowa farmers largely endorse adaptive action focused on preparing for more extreme weather events. However, attitudes toward adaptation action were associated with beliefs and perceived risks; farmers who believed that climate change is occurring <italic>and</italic> perceived threats specific to farming were significantly more likely to support action to protect land from future extreme weather. In other words, our findings suggest that it is when farmers believe in climate change and perceive it as a &#x0201c;problem&#x0201d; that their willingness to take action is activated. These results also point to potentially important pathways for climate change outreach to farmers. Farming requires more constant adaptation to weather and other biophysical contextual conditions than most occupations, thus farmers are by necessity professional problem solvers (<xref rid="bibr56-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Nowak, 2013</xref>). Strategies that appeal to farmers&#x02019; creative responses to the problem of extreme weather may be effective avenues for outreach focused on adaptation.</p><p>The extreme weather events that have impacted Midwest agriculture (<xref rid="bibr16-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2011</xref>) may be helping to move farmers and major agricultural actors toward a problematization of climate change. For example, a recent report from the 25&#x000d7;&#x02019;25 Alliance Adaptation Workgroup, a collaboration among major agriculture, forestry, and environmental organizations, highlights the vulnerabilities that recent extreme events have exposed in dominant cropping systems and calls for major adaptation action in agriculture (<xref rid="bibr1-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">25&#x000d7;&#x02019;25 Adaptation Initiative, 2013</xref>). This signals an increasing openness to action on climate change among major agricultural actors. Our results showing substantial farmer support for adaptation action, considered together with evidence that mainstream agricultural organizations are beginning to address the need for climate adaptation, point to opportunities to engage farmers and those agricultural actors through the lens of adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="section19-0013916513503832"><title>Mitigation Approaches</title><p>The findings on mitigation, however, point to a much different dynamic and signal that support for mitigation and adaptation are activated in distinct ways. Whereas support for adaptation seems to be related to the interplay between beliefs and perceived risks to agriculture, support for mitigation appears to be conditionally independent of perceived risks, and is associated primarily with belief that climate change is occurring (and due to human activity). Moreover, only one third of the farmers endorsed the item measuring support for government action on GHGs, and they were almost exclusively those who indicated that climate change is occurring and due to human activity. Consistent with our expectations and norm activation theory (<xref rid="bibr62-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Roser-Renouf &#x00026; Nisbet, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr66-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Stern, Dietz, Abel, Guagnano, &#x00026; Kalof, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bibr75-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Weber &#x00026; Stern, 2011</xref>), it appears that only those farmers who assign blame to humans see value in societal efforts to reduce GHGs.</p><p>Another important finding was the lack of a statistically significant relationship between perceived risks to agriculture (e.g., &#x0201c;potential impacts on my farm operation&#x0201d;) and support for mitigation. Given that the mitigation variable measured support for government action in a general sense (not specific to agriculture), and that the perceived risk items were specific to agriculture, this result is perhaps not surprising. Whereas adaptive action such as investment in protective conservation practices can have immediate positive impacts at the individual farm level, perhaps neutralizing climate risk, the climate-related impacts of government action on GHGs are diffuse and long-term. Future research might use measures of perceptions of more global, collective risks in addition to local, individual risks to further test variations in scale associated with mitigation.</p><p>Our findings suggest that for a majority of farmers, outreach that focuses on mitigation will not likely resonate. Most Iowa farmers do not believe that human actions are responsible for climate change. Furthermore, farmer concerns about potential (local) risks to agriculture were not associated with endorsement of government action on GHGs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section20-0013916513503832"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The consensus view among scientists is that to maintain long-term societal food security, we urgently need to reduce agriculture&#x02019;s vulnerability to predicted changes in climate and reduce GHG emissions (e.g., <xref rid="bibr31-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Hatfield et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr41-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Lal et al., 2011</xref>). The results of this study show that Iowa farmers, in general, seem to be willing to adapt to changing climate conditions and view their responses as risk management strategies to maintain crop productivity. However, perceptions of mitigation activities by government are less straightforward. Farmers who believe that climate change is happening and primarily anthropogenic are more likely to favor government action on GHGs, yet they represent a small fraction of the farmers in our sample. Moreover, more than half did not believe that climate change is occurring, were uncertain about its existence, or believed that it is primarily due to natural causes.</p><p>Our research suggests that farmers (and possibly the greater agricultural community) are more open to adaptation than mitigation. Farmers adapt for a living (<xref rid="bibr59-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">OECD, 2012</xref>), and they pride themselves on their ability to solve problems (<xref rid="bibr56-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Nowak, 2013</xref>). <xref rid="bibr45-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Lobell, Baldos, and Thomas (2013</xref>, p. 1) offer a solution to addressing agriculture&#x02019;s contribution to GHG emissions in their findings that &#x0201c;broad-based efforts to adapt agriculture to climate change have mitigation co-benefits&#x0201d; and note that adaptation is often considerably less expensive than actions whose main purpose is mitigation. Many of the practices that reduce vulnerability of cropping systems most effectively&#x02014;reductions in tillage, planting of a cover crop to hold soil during fallow periods, managing fertilizers more efficiently&#x02014;can also have significant GHG-reducing properties (<xref rid="bibr41-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr">Lal et al., 2011</xref>). By using outreach strategies that focus on adaptive practices that reduce risks and GHG emissions, the dual goals of adaptation and mitigation could be pursued while engaging the majority of farmers who do not believe in anthropogenic climate change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Online_appendix.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1517" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Iowa Agriculture and Home Economics Experiment Station and the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute for Food and Agriculture-Funded Cropping Systems Coordinated Agricultural Project: Climate Change, Mitigation, and Adaptation in Corn-based Cropping Systems project (Award No. 2011-68002-30190).</p></fn></fn-group><bio id="d35e1530"><title>Author Biographies</title><p><bold>J.
