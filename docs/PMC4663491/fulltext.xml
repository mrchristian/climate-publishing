intervals are equivocal. Here we show that all eight known radiometrically-dated
Tambora-sized or larger NH eruptions over the interval 30 to 80&#x02009;ka BP
are associated with abrupt Greenland cooling (&#x0003e;95% confidence). Additionally,
previous research reported a strong statistical correlation between the timing of
Southern Hemisphere volcanism and Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events (&#x0003e;99%
confidence), but did not identify a causative mechanism. Volcanic aerosol-induced
asymmetrical hemispheric cooling over the last few hundred years restructured
atmospheric circulation in a similar fashion as that associated with Last Glacial
millennial-scale shifts (albeit on a smaller scale). We hypothesise that following
both recent and Last Glacial NH eruptions, volcanogenic sulphate injections into the
stratosphere cooled the NH preferentially, inducing a hemispheric temperature
asymmetry that shifted atmospheric circulation cells southward. This resulted in
Greenland cooling, Antarctic warming, and a southward shifted ITCZ. However, during
the Last Glacial, the initial eruption-induced climate response was prolonged by NH
glacier and sea ice expansion, increased NH albedo, AMOC weakening, more NH cooling,
and a consequent positive feedback. Conversely, preferential SH cooling following
large SH eruptions shifted atmospheric circulation to the north, resulting in the
characteristic features of DO events.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Millennial scale climate change is one of the most characteristic and yet enigmatic
features of recent glacial intervals. From 30 to 80&#x02009;ka BP, glacial baseline
conditions were interrupted by 21 abrupt climate change events, termed
Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events, associated with warm interstadial conditions in
Greenland but colder conditions in Antarctica. The apparent temperature shifts were
locally dramatic; for example, DO Event 8 (DO-8) occurred 38.17&#x02009;ka BP, and
was characterised by 11.8&#x02009;&#x000b0;C Greenland warming<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,
which is comparable to warming across a full glacial-interglacial transition.
Additionally, evidence from high resolution Greenland ice cores suggests that Greenland
warming can occur extremely rapidly, potentially within 1 to 3 years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.
Any explanation for DO events must therefore account for both the rapidity and magnitude
of the observed temperature change. Similarly, any cause must also explain the apparent
hemispheric asymmetry characteristic of DO events; Greenland warming was associated with
Antarctic cooling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, a phenomenon known as the &#x02018;bipolar
see-saw&#x02019;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The hemispheric asymmetry is not restricted to
high latitudes. Increasing speleothem-based evidence indicates that DO events were
associated with substantial atmospheric reorganisation at low latitudes, with a
strengthening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> in the
Northern Hemisphere (NH) and a weakening of the South American Monsoon (SAM) and the
Australasian Monsoon (AM) in the Southern Hemisphere (SH)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.
Explanations for the asymmetric hemispheric response to DO events often invoke Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) shifts possibly induced by meltwater
pulses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, but this interpretation is not universally accepted,
and other proposed explanations include solar forcing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, internal
ocean-atmosphere oscillations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, and volcanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Because
the substantial climate shifts associated with DO event initiation can seemingly occur
on human timescales, identifying the underlying cause of such abrupt climate change and
considering these forcings in a modern context is critical.</p><p>Here we use published ice core (synchronised on the AICC2012 chronology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), volcanological, and speleothem-based evidence to argue that DO events were
triggered by asymmetrical hemispheric cooling caused by explosive SH volcanic eruptions.
Conversely, we argue that very large NH eruptions forced abrupt Greenland cooling events
and, under the right conditions, were associated with large ice rafting events (Heinrich
Stadials). This perspective is consistent with recent results suggesting that ice
rafting events were a consequence of, but did not trigger, NH cooling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.
Large explosive volcanic eruptions are conventionally thought to result in global
cooling for several years following the eruption, based on the concept that
stratospheric volcanogenic sulphate aerosols reflect solar radiation and cool the planet
essentially uniformly. Large low latitude eruptions are therefore often considered the
most climatologically significant because low latitudes receive a disproportionately
high amount of insolation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, although in-depth studies highlight
considerable complexities in the climate response to eruptions based on ejecta volume,
sulphate content, explosivity, and latitude<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>). However, global cooling
does not seem to have occurred following several large, well-documented Pleistocene
eruptions. For example, the Toba supereruption at ~74&#x02009;ka BP is
followed by lower NGRIP &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O (Greenland cooling) but higher
EDML &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O values (Antarctic warming), thereby providing no
support for homogeneous global cooling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Similarly, evidence from Lake
Malawi in east Africa does not show any evidence for substantial cooling at low
latitudes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The apparent absence of &#x02018;volcanic
winter&#x02019; in response to the largest eruption of the Quaternary is enigmatic
when considered from the conventional perspective. Similarly puzzling is the apparent
strengthening of the SAM and AM and concomitant weakening of the EASM coinciding with
the Toba eruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>However, very recent research focussing on the last 500 years has demonstrated the
importance of asymmetric hemispheric cooling induced by sulphate aerosol injections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> on atmospheric circulation. Observational, modelling, and proxy
studies now firmly implicate 20<sup>th</sup> Century anthropogenic sulphate aerosol
emissions with greater NH cooling compared to the SH, resulting in southward migration
of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), drying at NH low latitudes, and more
rainfall at SH low latitudes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Recent research also demonstrates
that this same asymmetric cooling effect occurred following the injection of sulphate
aerosols into the stratosphere following large volcanic eruptions over the last 100
years (based on instrumental data)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and 500 years (based on stalagmite
rainfall proxy data)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. These studies collectively demonstrate that over
the last few centuries NH aerosols (volcanogenic and anthropogenic) forced the ITCZ to
the south by cooling the NH relative to the SH, and that SH eruptions forced northward
ITCZ migration. The atmospheric and temperature response associated with the Toba
eruption is therefore consistent with the recently detected climate response to more
recent (but far smaller) NH eruptions. We suggest that the Toba eruption initiated
southward ITCZ migration by inducing a NH-SH temperature asymmetry, which resulted in
more SAM rainfall but reduced rainfall in the NH low latitudes (e.g., the EASM),
consistent with speleothem-based evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), and identical
to the response to NH eruptions over the last 500 years. A southward displaced ITCZ
would have shifted Hadley circulation cells to the south, compressing the SH Polar Cell,
forcing the SH Polar Front southward, and resulting in locally warmer Antarctic
temperatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>).
The opposite response would have occurred in the NH, where atmospheric reorganisation
would have resulted in extreme and sudden cooling in Greenland and extension of NH
glacial and sea ice, characteristics associated with the abrupt transition between DO-20
and Greenland Stadial (GS) 20 occurring at that time. We propose that the positive
feedbacks following NH eruptions (e.g., NH sea ice expansion, NH continental glacier
expansion, increased NH albedo, and AMOC weakening) prolonged the climatic response to
the Toba eruption by several hundred years, not dissimilar to recent results suggesting
that Little Ice Age cooling was initiated by NH volcanism in the 13<sup>th</sup>
Century but was sustained over hundreds of years by a positive feedback involving sea
ice and oceanic circulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The timing of the Toba supereruption is
consistent with the abrupt cooling into GS20, although this seems superimposed on a
cooling trend that began ~100 years earlier, potentially linked to
decreasing insolation. However, the Toba eruption is nearly indistinguishable from the
inception of Antarctic warming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>). We
suggest that large NH eruptions that occurred during interstadials abruptly ended
Greenland interstadial conditions and promoted a rapid transition to stadial conditions,
which were favoured during much of the Last Glacial because of low atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations and insolation conditions. Conversely, large NH eruptions
that occurred during already cold conditions resulted in less Greenland cooling but led
to glacier extension and Heinrich Events. This is supported by the established
association of the 39.280&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.110&#x02009;ka BP
Campanian Ignimbrite supereruption of the Campi Flegrei supervolcano with GS9 and
Heinrich Event 4 (HE4)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. We also note that the inception of HE5a at
~53&#x02009;ka BP is indistinguishable from the timing of the magnitude
(M) 7 Ischia eruption (53&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.3&#x02009;ka BP).
Additionally, all eight very large (M&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;7;
Tambora-sized or larger) Pleistocene NH eruptions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref> for selection criteria used)
are within error of a NH cooling event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), and Monte Carlo
simulations demonstrate that this relationship is significant at the 95% confidence
level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>The stratospheric sulphate loading associated with large SH eruptions could have had the
opposite effect, preferentially cooling the SH relative to the NH, shifting the ITCZ to
the north, compressing the NH Polar Cell, and shifting the NH Polar Front to the north
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>). We suggest
that this northward shift in the polar fronts in response to large SH eruptions resulted
in dramatic warming across the North Atlantic and NH glaciated regions, promoting sea
ice collapse and the partial retreat of continental ice sheets, all characteristic
features of DO events. The presence of large continental ice sheets would have provided
a strong positive feedback. The proposed northward NH Polar Front migration would have
caused continental ice sheet retreat, consequently reducing albedo, destabilising NH
permafrost, and resulting in subtle methane increases characteristic of DO events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. This is consistent with inferred minor perturbations to the carbon
cycle during DO events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, with the suggestion that atmosphere methane
that accumulated during DO events had a high latitude source<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and with
ice core evidence suggesting a substantial northward shift in methane source region
following DO event initiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The flux of radiocarbon-depleted carbon
into the atmosphere during DO events, often interpreted as AMOC strengthening and
increased outgassing of radiocarbon depleted-bottom waters, may also originate from
permafrost thaw, as previously suggested for the
B&#x000f8;lling/Aller&#x000f8;d<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The lower albedo and
strengthened AMOC following NH ice sheet decay following SH eruptions could have
produced a positive feedback that prevented the short-term re-establishment of
continental ice sheets to their full glacial extent as favoured by still low atmospheric
CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. This caused a gradual return to pre-eruption
conditions hundreds or even thousands of years after the initial sulphate forcing,
unless the slow process was expedited by a large NH eruption (forcing an abrupt return
to stadial conditions, as was the case following the Toba eruption) or the cooling
process was interrupted by another SH eruption, as may have occurred after an unknown SH
eruption triggered DO-13 at 49.5&#x02009;ka BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>Very recent research using ice core data from a high snow accumulation rate site in
Antarctica suggests that that the temperature signal associated with DO events
originated in the NH and was then transmitted to the SH ~200 years later by
oceanic processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Interestingly, the authors of the study highlight
the fact that the North Atlantic processes thought to have initiated DO events could
themselves have resulted from a remote and &#x02018;elusive&#x02019; trigger. We
propose that this trigger was a SH eruption, which initially cooled the SH for just
1&#x02013;5 years due to increased atmospheric aerosol loading. Existing proxy
records are too low resolution to detect this initial aerosol-induced cooling, but the
cooling was sufficient to shift atmospheric circulation to the north, warming NH high
latitudes, promoting NH ice sheet decay, strengthening AMOC, and initiating a positive
feedback mechanism. This NH warming could then have been propagated back to the SH
~200 years later, well after the initial volcanic aerosol-induced cooling
effects had abated. NH warming (triggered by a SH eruption) would have resulted in ice
shelf collapse, increased freshwater outputs to the North Atlantic, or reduced sea ice
extent, all previously suggested mechanisms driving DO events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.
These other processes could have resulted from and amplified the initial volcanic
forcing, possibly by inducing AMOC shifts which were propagated to the south
~200 years later<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><p>We focus on the interval from 30 to 80&#x02009;ka BP because of the high density of
millennial-scale climate oscillations within that interval, and because the proposed
mechanism would be most effective during intervals of time characterised by intermediate
ice volume and 65&#x000b0;N insolation, such as most of this interval (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Unfortunately, the volcanological catalogue of known eruptions
prior to 10&#x02009;ka BP is very incomplete because: (<italic>i</italic>) erosion removes
volcanic deposits from the geologic record and increases uncertainty associated with the
estimation of eruption magnitude, (<italic>ii</italic>) burial by younger deposits hides older
deposits from study, and (<italic>iii</italic>) many volcanoes still remain understudied or even
unknown. Even over only the last one thousand years, instances exist where evidence of
large eruptions is apparent in ice core volcanogenic sulphate records but the volcano
responsible has only recently been identified (e.g., Rinjani, 1257 A.D.) or is still
unknown (e.g., the 1809 A.D. eruption). Prior to the Holocene, large eruptions from SH
calderas are particularly underrepresented (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>).</p><p>Despite the apparent undercount and chronological uncertainties, over the interval from
30 to 80&#x02009;ka BP all five radiometrically-dated large
(M&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;6; Pinatubo-sized or larger) SH volcanic
eruptions are within chronological uncertainty of the initiation of a discrete DO event.
Too few radiometrically-dated SH eruptions exist to confidently assess the link with DO
events, but previous research linked direct evidence of SH eruptions derived from
optical dust logger data from Antarctic Siple Dome ice with DO events over the period 27
to 70&#x02009;ka<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The link between SH volcanism and DO events was
significant at the 99% confidence level, although a well-defined mechanistic link was
absent. We propose that this &#x02018;missing link&#x02019; is the now apparent
hemispheric temperature asymmetry induced by stratospheric volcanic aerosols, followed
by an ice/albedo and ocean circulation feedback. Future research should test the
hypothesis further by improve the dating of both climate and volcanological records, and
by using isotope-enabled GCM modelling.</p><p>This hypothesis not only clarifies the mechanisms that forced abrupt millennial scale
climate change during glacial conditions, but also helps predict future change. Large,
explosive eruptions may indeed lead to low latitude drought in the hemisphere of the
eruption, but our model suggests additional consequences that merit further
consideration. For example, an extremely large NH eruption might cause nearly global
cooling, but may result in localised SH high latitude warming by forcing the SH Polar
Front to the south. A sufficiently large atmospheric disruption could initiate or
accelerate the destabilisation of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Paradoxically, very
large eruptions could therefore not only cause substantial mean global cooling, but also
high latitude warming (in the hemisphere opposite the eruption), ice sheet collapse, and
catastrophic sea level rise.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Baldini, J. U.L. <italic>et al.</italic> Was millennial scale
