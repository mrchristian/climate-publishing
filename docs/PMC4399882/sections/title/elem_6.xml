  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Community and Species Distribution Modelling</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climatic suitability was modelled for the two grassland communities that make up the LNGT, the Lowland Themeda Grassland community (GTL) and the Lowland Poa Grassland community (GPL), as well as related grassy communities, the 
   <span class="italic">Bursaria-Acacia</span> woodland and scrub community (NBA) and the Lowland Grassland Complex (GCL). An understanding of the distribution of each community, in addition to its structurally dominant species, is necessary for the practical management and conservation of a listed community under changing conditions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GTL and GPL were modelled separately because they are expected to respond differently to changing climate variables due to the different photosynthetic pathways employed by their structurally dominant species. 
   <span class="italic">Poa labillardierei</span> is a C3 grass, while 
   <span class="italic">Themeda triandra</span> is a C4 grass. In general, it is expected that global warming will increase the dominance of C4 grasses, which have higher water efficiency, greater drought tolerance, and greater persistence in warmer climates than C3 species [
   <a rid="pone.0124014.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref018">18</a>]. However, the effect of elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub> and competitive interactions between C4 and C3 plants under different nutrient conditions and seasonality are not well understood [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Presence locations for each of the grassland communities were generated by randomly sampling 1000 points from within the existing distribution of each of the community types from the state-wide digital vegetation map, TASVEG3.0 [

   <span class="sup">th</span> century, and preferential clearing may have occurred in the past on more fertile soils or areas with fewer trees, the remaining grasslands are distributed within the likely extent of the original, so sampling the current distribution is a reasonable approximation to the range of suitable climatic conditions.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Maxent model [
   <a rid="pone.0124014.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref022">22</a>] was used to project the distribution of climate suitable for the grassland communities and species under current and future climate conditions. Maxent is a Species Distribution Model (SDM), or climate envelope model, which uses presence only data. SDMs are based on the statistical relationship between environmental or climatic variables and the current, observed distribution of a species or community. Assuming that this relationship remains unchanged, the future distribution of the species is then projected according to future climatic conditions. Other modelling approaches are available, including Boosted Regression Trees, Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models, and ensembles of these are sometimes used to represent the range in SDM outputs [

   <a rid="pone.0124014.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref026">26</a>]. For each model run, ten replicate Maxent runs were calculated by cross-validation and using default values for all other parameters (e.g. regularisation). Relative occurrence probabilities above 0.5 were considered suitable, following Phillips &amp; Dudík [

Our results therefore indicate relative climatic suitability rather than habitat suitability. In the absence of knowledge about the specific variables which determine grassland distributions in Tasmania, we used saturated models based on the full set of thirty five commonly used bioclimatic variables and allowed Maxent to perform variable selection.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future climate conditions were taken from a dynamically downscaled regional climate model, the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM), developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia. Six CMIP3 global climate models (ECHAM5/MPI-OM, GFDL-CM2.0, GFDL-CM2.1, UKMO-HadCM3, CSIRO Mk3.5 and MIROC3.2 (medres)) were downscaled to ~10km resolution by the Climate Futures for Tasmania project.

   <a rid="pone.0124014.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref039">39</a>]. The A2 scenario is broadly similar to the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, which replaced the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) emissions scenarios in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) fifth assessment report (AR5) and Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5). Regional comparisons of projections from the CMIP5 and CMIP3 models have found surface temperature, wind and rainfall patterns to be highly consistent between the archives [

Climate change grids for maximum and minimum temperature (Tmax, Tmin), precipitation and pan evaporation were calculated relative to the ANUCLIM baseline (1976–2005; 1970–1995 for evaporation), for two future periods representing 2040–2069 and 2070–2099 (hereafter 2050 and 2080, the mean values of the 30 year periods).
