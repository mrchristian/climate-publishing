 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effective conservation of threatened ecological communities into the future requires some knowledge of where climatically suitable habitat is likely to persist under changing climatic conditions. When projections suggest that there may be no suitable area for a community in the future, management objectives need to be reassessed, and alternative options developed, with the dual aims of protecting high conservation value species as components of different communities, and protecting ecosystem function.</p>
