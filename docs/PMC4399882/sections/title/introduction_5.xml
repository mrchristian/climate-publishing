 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Distributions of species and communities are shifting due to changing climatic conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref004">4</a>], and attempts to maintain the status quo in terms of species composition may be futile in many regions of the world. Variability through time is an inherent part of ecosystem behaviour, but conservation management frequently relies on a static view of ecosystems [
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref005">5</a>]. Listed ecological communities are bound by environmental legislation that sets thresholds for acceptable condition, species richness and composition. For conservation management to be effective in the future, it will need to accommodate changing ecological dynamics. Options that enable the diversity, structure and function of ecosystems to be maintained will need to be identified, rather than attempting to preserve current species composition.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperate grasslands are among the most threatened vegetation types on Earth, since they occur in those environments most amenable to human settlement and agriculture [
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref006">6</a>]. In Australia, lowland temperate grasslands are a national conservation priority, with less than 1% of their original extent remaining [
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref007">7</a>]. Lowland temperate grasslands are dominated by native grasses, with few or no emergent woody species. The dominant grasses are tussock-forming, and a variety of small forbs or wildflowers and non-tussock forming grasses and sedges occur in the inter-tussock spaces. Remnant patches in good condition are species-rich and are important habitat to a diverse array of flora and fauna, many of which are also listed as vulnerable or threatened.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tasmanian Lowland Temperate Native Grasslands (LNGT) are listed as Critically Endangered on the 
  <span class="italic">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</span>, the Australian Government’s national environmental legislation. Less than 10% of the natural extent of this community remains [
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref008">8</a>] and most is on privately-owned land. The LNGT are comprised of two main floristic types, determined by the dominant grass species. The Lowland Themeda Grassland community (GTL) is dominated by 
  <span class="italic">Themeda triandra</span> (Kangaroo grass) and the Lowland Poa Grassland community (GPL) is dominated by 
  <span class="italic">Poa labillardierei</span> (Tussockgrass). 
  <span class="italic">Austrodanthonia</span> spp. (Wallabygrass) and/or 
  <span class="italic">Austrostipa</span> spp. (Speargrass) may also be present, along with a diverse assemblage of herbs and forbs, and few woody or shrubby species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Native grassland communities in Tasmania are often represented by small, highly fragmented remnants, which vary greatly in condition due to past land uses such as grazing, burning and use of fertilisers. Current condition is likely to be important for the long-term viability of a community, with grasslands in better condition more resilient to change in the short term, and more adaptable in the long term, due to their greater genetic, floristic and structural diversity [
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref009">9</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref012">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Management of threatened ecological communities requires some knowledge of where climatically suitable habitat is likely to persist into the future [
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref013">13</a>]. In contrast to the common approach of modelling changes to the distribution of a single species of interest under climate change, we model the distribution of a listed ecological community as a whole. Where dominant species are widespread, but the community has a highly restricted distribution, modelling climatic suitability for the dominant species will tend to overestimate the extent of suitable climate for the community. Modelling the extent of the community is more likely to capture important limiting factors and interactions [
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref014">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Average temperatures in Tasmania are projected to increase by 2.6 to 3.3°C by the end of this century under a high emissions scenario (A2) [
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref015">15</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref016">16</a>]. Temperature change is projected to be fairly uniform across Tasmania, and broadly similar across seasons. In contrast, total annual rainfall is not projected to change, but there are significant changes in the spatial pattern and seasonality of rainfall. Annual rainfall is projected to increase over coastal regions, and decrease in parts of northwest and central Tasmania where the grasslands currently occur. In these areas, autumn rainfall is projected to increase significantly after 2050, and decrease in spring. The suitability of future climatic conditions for temperate grasslands may therefore be influenced by changes to seasonality and interactions between climate variables, in addition to changes to mean conditions. Shifts in the floristics, structure and phenology of grassland communities, with a consequent loss of habitat and changed composition of species assemblages, are expected to occur as a direct response to the changing climate [
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref010">10</a>]. Other, indirect effects are likely, including changes in soil properties and nutrient cycling, changes to fire regimes, increased risk of weed invasion, and changes in land use and management, including “drought-proofing” through irrigation and enterprise diversification such as new crops and carbon plantings.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several vegetation communities similar in composition and geographic extent that are likely to be important in the long-term conservation of the LNGT. Firstly, the Lowland Grassland Complex (GCL) includes grasslands that are not classified as LNGT because they have insufficient cover of 
  <span class="italic">Poa labillardierei</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Themeda triandra</span>. They have a significantly greater extent than LNGT, and may play an important functional role in maintaining grassland species across the landscape. GCL are mostly derived from prior clearing of native grassy, dry woodland and forest communities or from eucalypt dieback events [
  <a rid="pone.0124014.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124014.ref017">17</a>]. Secondly, the 
  <span class="italic">Bursaria-Acacia</span> woodland and scrub community (NBA) grades with LNGT but is excluded from LNGT where 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">spinosa</span> exceeds 30% cover. This community has an herb-rich grassy understorey dominated by 
  <span class="italic">Themeda triandra</span> with emergent 
  <span class="italic">Bursaria spinosa</span> shrubs (up to 3–4 m). The structure of NBA is often an artefact of fire and grazing history, and increased frequency of burning can promote grassland vegetation and reduce shrub cover. Grasslands form a continuum with grassy woodlands dominated by various 
  <span class="italic">Eucalyptus</span> species, which could be an important component of the management matrix if managed to maintain or favour grasslands.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper we identify possible options for managing threatened communities under climate change, using the Lowland Grassland community (LNGT) in Tasmania, Australia as a case study. Firstly, we test whether future climate conditions are likely to remain suitable for the lowland grassland communities which make up the LNGT (GTL and GPL), and for their structurally dominant species. We also model current and future climatic suitability for closely related grassland (GCL) and woodland communities (NBA) in order to identify options for management in the event that future climatic conditions become unsuitable for the current lowland grassland community.</p>
