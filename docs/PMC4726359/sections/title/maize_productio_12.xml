  <span class="bold">a</span>) Maize production area according to county-level data. (
  <span class="bold">b</span>) Location of CMB and weather stations. (
  <span class="bold">c</span>) Temperature changes (increases in all cases) from 1980–2009. (
  <span class="bold">d</span>) Solar radiation change from 1980–2009. (
  <span class="bold">e</span>) Average precipitation in the 2000s. (
  <span class="bold">f</span>) Average precipitation in regions of the CMB in the 1980s and 2000s. In any region, the precipitation during the maize growing season did not significantly differ between the 1980s vs. the 2000s (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05). NE, NCP, and SW refer to Northeast China, the North China Plain, and Southwest China, respectively. Error bars indicate one standard deviation. We first made the standard module with ArcGIS 10.0 for the province level and then copied to the PowerPoint 2010. Then we made the individual map. Second, the maps in Fig. 1a–f were generated in PowerPoint 2010.
