Spring maize was the dominant maize system in the NE (Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning Provinces), and the SW (Yunan, Guizhou, Chongqing, and Sichuan Provinces) while summer maize was the dominant system in the NCP (Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Beijing and Tianjin Provinces). In Shanxi and Shannxi Provinces in the NCP, maize was mainly sown in spring.
