  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Field work was carried out from 2006 to 2013 to assess meadow pipit and chiffchaff abundance in 556 localities ranging from 7 to 2110 m a.s.l. along a 1500 km belt crossing the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g002">Fig 2</a>). Permissions were not required because we counted birds in free-access lands. At these points we recorded all individuals seen or heard at either side of 500 m-long line transects irrespective of the perpendicular distance at which each individual was detected. The number of individuals recorded per line transect is a common index of bird abundance in extensive bird counts [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref051">51</a>]. In each transect, we measured some vegetation traits in two 25-m radius circles separated by 200-m intervals. In each circle, we visually estimated grass cover and shrub and tree layers (shrub under 0.5 m, between 0.5–2 m and &gt;2 min height). We also recorded the number of tree and shrub species within the circles. The scores of the two sampling circles were averaged to characterize each line transect (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0146958.s001">S1 Table</a>). We conducted a principal components analysis to reduce tree and shrub cover and richness to just one score. We retained a single principal component (eigenvalue: 2.80), which explained 55.94% of variance and was interpreted as a gradient of increasing vegetation cover (factor loadings for vegetation cover under 0.5m height: -0.01; cover 0.5–2 m height; 0.84; cover &gt;2 m height: 0.77; shrub species: 0.84 and tree species: 0.90). Factor scores of each locality within the component were used as an index of shrub and tree development (woodland). The location of locality (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees) was recorded with GPS devices.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed climate conditions of the study sites by using mean scores provided by Worldclim 1.4 for the 1950–2000 period [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref052">52</a>]. Since we propose that small birds avoid cold areas to prevent excessive thermoregulatory requirements, and precipitation may affect the productivity of Mediterranean habitats after summer drought (see 
   <a rid="sec001" ref-type="sec" href="#sec001">Introduction</a>), we selected Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter (bio11) and Precipitation of Coldest Quarter of the year (bio19) as the two main climate correlates of bird distribution. In addition, we included Precipitation Seasonality (bio15) as a surrogate of the rain-mediated productive pulses typical of many dry habitats that track migratory birds [

   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref054">54</a>]. Finally, to test if the present spatial patterning of climate variables is similar to that provided by Worldclim for the second half of the twentieth century, we requested from World Weather (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.tutiempo.net/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://en.tutiempo.net/</span>) the available climate data (years 2012–2013) in 25 meteorological stations located along the study area (from Avilés 43.55°N, 6.03°W to Sidi Ifini 29.36°N, 10.18°W). Despite strong differences in sample size affecting the means (50 vs. 2 years), climate variables depicted similar trends (bio 11, r: 0.93; bio15:0.69 and bio19:0.70, p&lt;0.001 in all cases) supporting the usefulness of climate data used in this paper to explore the features affecting the present spatial distribution of birds.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used meadow pipit and chiffchaff abundance distribution as response variables and climate (temperature, precipitation, precipitation seasonality) and vegetation structure (grass and woodland cover) as predictor variables. The effect of latitude (and the potential effect of spatial autocorrelation) on bird abundance was also included by means of the line transects’ coordinates, latitude, longitude and latitude x longitude [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref055">55</a>]. To deal with the large number of zeros in transects (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g002">Fig 2</a>) we used the hurdle count model approach provided by pscl-R [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref056">56</a>]. These models are two-component models with a hurdle component that models the zero counts and a truncated count component for positive counts [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref057">57</a>]. The count model is normally a truncated Poisson or negative binomial regression (with log link). The hurdle model is a bionomial logit regression or a censored count distribution model [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref056">56</a>]. We used the Akaike's Information Criterion [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref058">58</a>] to select the best model and variable combination with lmtest-R [
