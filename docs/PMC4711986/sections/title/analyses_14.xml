 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used meadow pipit and chiffchaff abundance distribution as response variables and climate (temperature, precipitation, precipitation seasonality) and vegetation structure (grass and woodland cover) as predictor variables. The effect of latitude (and the potential effect of spatial autocorrelation) on bird abundance was also included by means of the line transectsâ€™ coordinates, latitude, longitude and latitude x longitude [

  <a rid="pone.0146958.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g002">Fig 2</a>) we used the hurdle count model approach provided by pscl-R [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref056">56</a>]. These models are two-component models with a hurdle component that models the zero counts and a truncated count component for positive counts [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref057">57</a>]. The count model is normally a truncated Poisson or negative binomial regression (with log link). The hurdle model is a bionomial logit regression or a censored count distribution model [
