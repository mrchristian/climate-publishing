 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the data provided by line transects to test the ability of Maxent models to predict bird distribution. To do this, we divided the occurrence probability resulting from Maxent into three similar interval sectors between the min-max intervals. The resulting ranges were used to define maps of low, medium and high climate suitability for each species. The line transects were distributed within these sectors to test with Ï‡

In addition, since the distribution models were launched to predict climate suitability, the effect of habitat structure on bird distribution was controlled by selecting the habitats mainly used by pipits (grasslands, farmlands, wooded pasturelands; n = 375) and chiffchaffs (wooded pasturelands, farmlands, scrublands, woodlands; n = 320) according to current information on winter habitat preferences [

  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref047">47</a>]. In this way, we tried to avoid the absences resulting from the unsuitability of some habitats.
