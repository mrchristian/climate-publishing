  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref041">41</a>]) feeds on invertebrates in meadows and grasses of open habitat patches [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref042">42</a>]. The chiffchaff (7.8 g) feeds on insects within a broader set of substrata and occurs in tree- and shrub-covered habitats [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref043">43</a>]. These passerines were selected as model species for two reasons. First, they do not breed in the study area (the meadow pipit) or mainly breed in some areas of the northern Iberian Peninsula (the chiffchaff; [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref044">44</a>]). Thus, most if not all birds wintering in the study area are migratory individuals [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref045">45</a>â€“
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref047">47</a>]. This trait is interesting from a methodological point of view because it will attenuate the confounding effects of local conspecifics on the abundance patterning of migratory individuals [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref048">48</a>]. In this way, predictions based on ring recoveries in wintering grounds can be validated by the abundance distribution of the same migratory populations [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref049">49</a>]. Second, pipits and chiffchaffs are small insectivorous passerines that occur in a broad range of habitats [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref042">42</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref043">43</a>]. Small body size makes birds more sensitive to temperature [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref020">20</a>] and a diet based on insects makes them potentially ubiquitous since these invertebrates are available in a wide range of habitats [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref050">50</a>]. This implicitly assumes the potential of these species to track climate changes across the entire study area.
