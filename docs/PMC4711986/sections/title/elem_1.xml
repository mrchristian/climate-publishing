 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modern climate change is a main driver of large-scale species distribution, but its actual effects on individual species will result from a variety of context-dependent processes that need to be explicitly studied at the proper scales [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref003">3</a>]. This involves investigating the way climate change affects the environment requirements of organisms and how they cope with the changes through relocation, phenotypic plasticity or adaptation [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref004">4</a>]. Only in this way it is possible to understand the potential effects of changes on species and to design preventive or proactive measures to cope with them realistically [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref005">5</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Migratory birds are sensitive to climate change in the different geographical sectors along their migratory journeys [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref006">6</a>]. This itinerancy makes it difficult to explore the potential effect of climate change on these species [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref007">7</a>]. In the case of European migratory birds, it has been predicted that many trans-Saharan species will reduce and shift their wintering range due to the effect of climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref008">8</a>], but little is known about the fate of wintering grounds in the Palaearctic [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref009">9</a>]. Some evidence suggests a shift northwards of wintering ranges in some European birds but few studies have investigated the impacts of climate change on wintering areas in the Mediterranean Basin [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref009">9</a>]. This is, however, a main wintering ground for many European bird populations [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref010">10</a>] because the arrival of autumn rains mitigates the limiting effects of summer drought initiating a period of primary productivity, invertebrate activity and fruit ripening suitable for wintering birds [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref011">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Mediterranean basin is located at the southwestern border of the Palaeartic (
  <a rid="pone.0146958.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g001">Fig 1</a>), which is expected to suffer stronger effects in terms of climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref013">13</a>]. Thus, it is suspected that climate change will influence the extent and suitability of this wintering ground for birds, but no information is available on the potential strength and spatial distribution of changes. These changes have potential conservation implications because can affect the survival or the subsequent reproductive success of migratory birds and thus their populations trends [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref014">14</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref016">16</a>]. In the current work, we study the potential effect of climate change in two common passerines (the meadow pipit 
  <span class="italic">Anthus pratensis</span> and the chiffchaff 
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus collybita</span>) wintering in the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb. More explicitly, we address the following objectives:

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of climate on the present distribution of migratory birds</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assess the effects of climate on the abundance distribution of pipits and chiffchaffs in a set of study localities along a 1500 km-long belt crossing Spain and Morocco (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g002">Fig 2</a>). This is a preliminary step to understand the effect of climate change on birds. We assume that climate can affect the distribution of wintering passerines in two main ways. First, food availability (e.g. seeds, fruits, invertebrates) is ultimately derived from plants and the effect of climate on plant productivity (e.g. through precipitation or temperature) influences bird abundance [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref017">17</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref018">18</a>]. Second, low temperatures increase the energy demands of these small birds, which are then forced to increase food intake to cope with thermoregulatory requirements [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref019">19</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref020">20</a>]. As a result, it can be postulated that the occupation of warm areas will decrease the need for thermogenesis and thus reduce individual daily energy requirements, enabling more birds to occur at a given level of productivity [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref021">21</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref022">22</a>]. However, this effect of climate on bird distribution could be affected by the competing effects of other geographical and environmental features [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref023">23</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref024">24</a>]. For instance, pipits and chiffchaffs arrive at the study area from the north. This seasonal afflux of birds could decrease the number of individuals involved in the colonization of the southern border of the winter range. This is usually related to the positive effect of migration length on mortality and energetic costs [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref025">25</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref026">26</a>]. Similar effects have already been reported in this wintering ground, where migratory fluxes affect winter distribution of birds [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref027">27</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref028">28</a>]. In addition, birds are strongly affected by vegetation structure so that the availability of suitable sites will strongly affect their presence in a given area [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref029">29</a>]. Thus, given the multiple determinants of bird distribution, we use a multivariate approach to assess the relative contribution of climate vs. other geographical and habitat predictors on the distribution of pipits and chiffchaffs.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modelling the present distribution of climate suitability</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use climate variables affecting pipit and chiffchaff abundance to predict the distribution of the most suitable wintering grounds. To do this, we use the spatial distribution of winter ring records provided by the European Union for Bird Ringing (Euring; 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.euring.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.euring.org/</span>) to explore the distribution of species. As these recoveries are widely distributed throughout the study area (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g002">Fig 2</a>) they can be used to explore the environmental preferences of birds. The models will be constructed with Maxent, a popular machine-learning technique designed to predict the occurrence probabilities of species by combining species presences (latitude and longitude) with the geographical distribution of climate variables [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref030">30</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref031">31</a>]. The ability of these maps to identify sectors of different climatic suitability will be tested with the distribution of pipits and chiffchaffs in the study localities (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g002">Fig 2</a>). If the actual occupancy and abundance [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref032">32</a>] of birds agree with the occurrence probability maps, we will use the models to forecast the changes in the extent and suitability of wintering areas according to predictions of climate change. This approach assumes a "space-for-time" design, which attempts to predict temporal changes from present spatial correlates between species distribution and climate variables [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we use the validated distribution models to forecast the suitability of wintering grounds according to climate projections. The effect of climate change on breeding bird distribution has already been studied in the western Mediterranean [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref034">34</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref035">35</a>], but little is known about the way climate change will affect winter bird ranges. It has been predicted, for instance, that warming will improve the suitability of colder sectors, such as mountain and highlands [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref036">36</a>]. Climate predictions also suggest a reduction in precipitation in some southern areas that could reduce primary productivity [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref037">37</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref038">38</a>] and the concomitant suitability of present wintering grounds for some species [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref039">39</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref040">40</a>]. Thus, climate changes will likely be affected by latitudinal and altitudinal gradients producing a patchy distribution of the future climate trends. This study attempts to map the location and extent of these changes in climate suitability of the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb for the two study species.
