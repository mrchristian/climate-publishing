  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0073">2014</a>). Anthropogenic climate change has altered global ocean temperatures and acidity, which influence other critical oceanographic properties, including global sea level, polar sea ice coverage, ocean circulation and stratification, and oxygen concentrations (reviewed in Doney 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0020">2012</a>). Diverse biological responses are associated with these physical and chemical changes. Responses such as shifts in species distribution, community composition, phenology, and abundance are largely consistent with climate change predictions (Poloczanska 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0071">2013</a>). However, the rates and magnitude of physical or chemical changes, and their associated biological impacts, are not identical across marine ecosystems (Burrows 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0005">2011</a>; Pinsky

  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0070">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the scope of climate change impacts on marine environments requires integration of empirical observations, theory, and models across disciplines. Nevertheless, specific marine disciplines often apply distinct methodologies that operate at disparate scales, influencing interpretations of global responses to climate (Parmesan, 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0065">2007</a>). Studies of climate‐driven change in marine environments may be impeded by spatially limited or generally short ocean time series, which are often inadequate to establish the necessary baselines upon which to assess change (Rosenzweig 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0083">2008</a>; Brown 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0004">2011</a>). The highest confidence in attribution of biological impacts to climate change occurs at the scale of ocean basins or larger (Parmesan 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0067">2011</a>). Long‐term marine biological datasets are particularly lacking compared to key physical records (Brierley &amp; Kingsford, 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0003">2009</a>; Edwards 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0023">2010</a>; Koslow &amp; Couture, 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0046">2015</a>), yet they are necessary to understand how physical and chemical environmental changes may drive biological change. Mismatches in spatial and temporal sampling of biological responses compared to physical processes complicate climate change studies that require separation of complex natural cycles from climate change impacts (Hobday &amp; Evans, 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0036">2013</a>; Parmesan 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0068">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies on climate‐driven ocean change rarely involve simultaneous sampling across physical, chemical, and biological systems over extended temporal or spatial scales, nor do they commonly incorporate natural climate variability (Edwards 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0023">2010</a>). Incompatible datasets, scale issues, and inappropriate statistical tests can limit inference in assessing broad effects across disciplines in marine climate change studies (Brown 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0004">2011</a>; O'Connor 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0063">2015</a>). Interactions among multiple climate and nonclimate stressors (e.g., fishing, pollution, habitat change), translation of controlled laboratory findings to real‐world dynamics, and geographic biases persist in ocean change research (Wernberg 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0091">2012</a>), presenting additional challenges when comparing and integrating discipline‐specific studies. The multitude of cross‐discipline challenges associated with ocean change research raises fundamental questions, such as how sampling approaches for identification of ocean change vary across disciplines and what this variation means to our interpretations of climate change impacts in marine systems.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our goal was to address these questions by reviewing the types of data available to detect changing ocean conditions across multiple marine disciplines, identifying disciplinary trends, and detecting areas where discourse on marine climate change has been lacking. We reviewed highly cited, contemporary literature on ocean change to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current discourse on climate change in marine environments. Specifically, we considered the following: (1) geographic scope of ocean change studies, (2) the spatial and temporal scales used to describe ocean change, (3) the oceanographic stressors implicated in biological responses, (4) the types of biological responses reported, and (5) field observations vs. laboratory manipulations. Our review encompasses hundreds of physical, chemical, and biological observations representing 19 specific research foci, or ‘themes’. We believe that enhanced recognition and understanding of discipline‐specific differences and data limitations in ocean change research, as revealed by this review, will improve interpretation and communication of contemporary changes in marine ecosystems. No previous syntheses of marine climate impacts, to our knowledge, have examined in similar detail such a wide range of research foci among several marine disciplines. In particular, our comparison across biological and physical/chemical realms is a novel approach that helps identify key disciplinary differences that may affect interpretation of ocean change research. Our interdisciplinary approach reveals research areas worthy of expansion. For example, we suggest geographic regions that provide unique opportunities for more integrated studies considering multiple stressors, standardization of biologically meaningful metrics when synthesizing spatial and temporal scales of ocean change, and expanded support for interdisciplinary training and efforts.</p>
