 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined 545 biological responses from the 311 highly cited studies investigating potential biological changes (Table 
  <a rid="gcb12978-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#gcb12978-tbl-0001">1</a>). Nearly 30% of these responses were measured in laboratory settings, but this varied greatly among biological subdisciplines and themes. For example, &gt;50% of the biological responses among fish, archaeo‐, bacterio‐, and phytoplankton were measured in the laboratory compared to ≤5% for mangroves, birds, mammals, and turtles, clearly reflecting differences in tractability of experimental manipulations. For 85% of the biological changes examined in our database, the authors concluded that their results could be attributed to physical or chemical changes in the marine environment. Other factors, such as anthropogenic activities (e.g., fishing) or habitat degradation, were sometimes considered. It was not the goal of this review to assess confidence in the attribution of climate change impacts on marine systems, although other studies have addressed this issue extensively (e.g., Poloczanska 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified 11 categories of primary physical and chemical stressors among the biological response studies: atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate indices (e.g., Pacific decadal oscillation), dissolved oxygen, ocean acidification (e.g., pH, alkalinity, pCO
  <sub>2</sub>), salinity, sea ice, sea level height, storms and precipitation, temperature (including SST, bottom temperature, or occasionally air temperature), upwelling processes, and secondary effects of physical changes (e.g., changes in physical habitat due to changes in temperature and chemistry). Most studies examined a response to a single stressor (59%; Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0004">4</a>). Two stressors were occasionally studied (30%), and three or more were rarely studied (11%). Vertebrate studies examined multiple stressors more frequently than the other two biological subdisciplines. There was no association between the number of stressors examined and year of publication (Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0004">4</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most frequent primary stressor considered among all three biological subdisciplines was temperature (44%; Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0005">5</a>a), as found in Poloczanska 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0071">2013</a>). Ocean acidification (‘OA’) was the second most common primary stressor studied (36%). While the effects of OA were studied across all three biological subdisciplines, it was primarily examined in studies of benthic communities. Studies considering the effects of sea ice were largely focused on vertebrates. The other eight primary stressors constituted &lt;10% of the biological response studies with salinity, upwelling, and dissolved oxygen being the least studied stressors. Laboratory studies were used to examine the biological responses of a variety of stressors, including climate indices, dissolved oxygen, acidification, salinity, and temperature. Laboratory experiments involving OA were particularly common (65% of laboratory studies), followed by temperature (28%).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Primary stressors associated with each biological theme varied considerably (Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0005">5</a>b). Temperature was the main stressor examined in plankton communities (61%) and was commonly examined across all benthic communities (35%) and vertebrate (45%) themes. Within benthic communities, the mangrove theme was unique in largely focusing on the effects of sea level height. Moreover, mangroves were the only theme for which atmospheric carbon dioxide was considered; this could be because they are directly vulnerable to both marine and atmospheric stressors. With the exception of mangroves, OA was the main stressor examined in benthic communities (52%). In particular, more than 50% of the rocky/sandy bottom and coral reef studies examined biological responses to OA. In contrast, fish studies were the only vertebrate theme investigating OA, all of which were conducted in the laboratory. With the exception of sea turtles, all vertebrate themes examined sea ice as a stressor, with mammal studies in particular having a strong focus on sea ice impacts (88% of mammal studies).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A variety of responses were examined across each of the biological themes within eight general categories: reproductive fitness (e.g., number of offspring produced), physiological effects (e.g., calcification rate, stress hormone response), phenological shifts, changes in distribution or range shift, dietary effects (e.g., body condition, diet, foraging preferences), changes in community structure (e.g., species composition), behavioral effects (e.g., antipredator response), or changes in population abundance and demography (e.g., recruitment rate, number of individuals). A single study examined evolutionary adaptation as a function of change in population growth (i.e., Lohbeck 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0053">2012</a>), which was included as a demographic response. Physiological changes (31%) and changes in abundance (30%) were most frequently reported (Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0006">6</a>), followed by shifts in reproductive fitness (12%). The remaining five categories each constituted &lt;10% of the responses reported. Physiological responses were most frequently measured in benthic communities, and nearly half (47%) were measured in the laboratory. Abundance studies were more evenly divided among the biological subdisciplines (Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0006">6</a>a) and were examined by all themes, but with varying frequency (Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0006">6</a>b). Notably, changes in abundance were the main response studied by all themes in plankton communities. Dietary effects were not considered in any of the benthic communities studies included in this review, yet nearly all plankton and vertebrate studies examined dietary effects. Vertebrate studies exhibited the greatest diversity of biological response types, with turtle and bird studies often focusing on reproductive success and phenology more than any other themes.
