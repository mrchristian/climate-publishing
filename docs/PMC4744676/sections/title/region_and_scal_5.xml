 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each study, we recorded the temporal scale (i.e., study duration in years or fractions of years), spatial scale (i.e., approximate study area in km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), and geographic region of the study site or the field origin of laboratory organisms (see Table S1). We incorporated studies with continuous, periodic, or snapshot sampling, as done in other syntheses (e.g., Poloczanska 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0071">2013</a>). If the exact study area was not provided, we used inset maps or geographic descriptions to determine approximate latitude and longitude for estimating study area. In the spatial and temporal analysis, we did not analyze studies that lacked adequate information to estimate temporal or spatial scale, or those that were conducted exclusively in the laboratory. In a few cases (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 9 papers), multiple spatial and temporal scales were described (e.g., when a laboratory study and field study were reported in the same study). In these cases, we used the maximum field study area or duration reported. We performed a two‐step cluster analysis (
  <span class="sc">ibm spss statistics</span> for Windows, version 19.0., IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA), using study area and duration as clustering criteria to identify natural ‘study scale’ groupings (i.e., clusters) in the data. We specified the log‐likelihood distance measure and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to construct the clusters and compared distributions of the cluster outputs using a nonparametric Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.
