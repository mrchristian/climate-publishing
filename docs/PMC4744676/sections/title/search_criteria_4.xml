 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We searched the peer‐reviewed ocean change literature using Web of Science, Google Scholar, citation lists, seminal review papers, and relevant journals (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">Global Change Biology</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Global Ecology and Biogeography</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Geophysical Research Letters</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Journal of Physical Oceanography</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Marine Ecology Progress Series</span>). We used the number of citations in Google Scholar to identify the five most cited papers published per year from 2007 to 2012 for each theme, yielding a maximum of 30 papers per theme (see Appendix S1). We selected the 2007–2012 time frame as a pragmatic way to confine our searches, to assure that at least 1 year had elapsed to estimate number of citations, and to roughly coincide with the literature used in the most recent release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports. Our search terms included combinations of ‘change’, ‘marine’, ‘climate change’, specific biological themes, and/or specific physical or chemical themes (e.g., ‘coral reef change’ or ‘coral reef ocean acidification’). We excluded review papers and projections of future change in an effort to strictly assess recent and direct observations of climate‐related changes in marine environments, taken in both field and laboratory settings. Finally, at least one (and up to three) expert for each theme reviewed our list of highly cited studies to identify any influential studies that we potentially missed.
