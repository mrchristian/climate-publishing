 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We reviewed a total of 461 ocean change peer‐reviewed papers, including 311 papers from biological subdisciplines (i.e., ‘benthic communities’, ‘vertebrates’, and ‘plankton communities’) and 150 from the physical/chemical oceanographic discipline. There were not always five papers available within each year for all designated themes, resulting in the review of fewer than 30 papers for some themes. In such instances, these papers were not only the most highly cited in that year, but also the only papers found. There was complete coverage (i.e., 30 papers per theme) of the physical/chemical discipline, but incomplete coverage of ocean change studies for all plankton themes, some benthic themes, and some vertebrate themes (Table 
  <a rid="gcb12978-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#gcb12978-tbl-0001">1</a>). Number of citations per paper ranged among disciplines and themes, with the physical/chemical discipline attracting up to 1128 citations (i.e., for the ‘sea ice’ theme) compared to a maximum of 306 citations for the ‘zooplankton’ theme in the plankton communities subdiscipline (Table 
  <a rid="gcb12978-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#gcb12978-tbl-0001">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geographically, we identified biases in the global distribution of highly cited ocean change studies that were not proportional to regional ocean surface area (Eakins &amp; Sharman, 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0022">2010</a>). For example, the North and South Pacific basins cover the greatest proportion of the Earth's ocean surface (21% and 25%, respectively), yet did not represent the most frequently studied regions in our review (Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0001">1</a>). Instead, the North Atlantic basin (12% of the global ocean surface) accounted for the greatest number (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 96, 21%) of highly cited ocean change studies, followed by the Arctic basin (area = 4.3%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 67, 15%). The Mediterranean Sea, making up &lt;1% of the ocean surface, was also frequently studied (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 26, 6% of studies) relative to its total surface area. Arctic studies were dominated by physical (sea ice) and vertebrate (primarily marine mammal) studies, whereas there was a more equal representation of all physical/chemical and biological disciplines among highly cited studies performed in the North Atlantic. The dominance of benthic studies in the Mediterranean was due to the abundance of shallow, coastal volcanic carbon dioxide vents providing natural sites to study the effects of acidification on benthic communities (e.g., Hall‐Spencer 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0029">2008</a>; Rodolfo‐Metalpa 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0081">2011</a>). Relative to their expansive spatial coverage, the Indian (20% surface area) and South Pacific basins (25% surface area) were studied less frequently (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 14, 3% and 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 59, 13%, respectively) and studies in those regions were primarily focused on coastal benthic communities. The South Atlantic (11% surface area) and Southern Ocean (6% surface area) were also poorly represented among the papers we reviewed (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 11, 2% and 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 20, 4%, respectively), but had more equal representation from the four physical/chemical and biological disciplines, with the exception of the benthic communities subdiscipline in the Southern Ocean. Benthic studies were nearly absent from the highly cited ocean change research in polar regions.

   <p>Regional distribution of 461 highly cited ocean change studies from physical/chemical discipline and biological subdisciplines across global oceans. The number of papers and proportional surface area (Eakins &amp; Sharman,

 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Few highly cited studies (~1%) involved organisms exclusively grown and monitored in laboratory settings (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 5) or studies that looked broadly over the extent of the entire tropical region (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 7). Highly cited studies spanning the tropical ocean region were primarily physical/chemical, but a couple of benthic coral reef meta‐analyses were also represented at this scale (e.g., Carpenter 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0007">2008</a>; McCulloch 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0060">2012</a>). A number of studies, primarily physical/chemical and plankton communities, were conducted in multiple regions (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 48, 10%) or explored global patterns (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 55, 12%). The physical/chemical discipline was particularly well represented at a global scale because authors used statistics to interpolate discrete samples from a cruise, buoy, or remote sensing to be representative of the broader ocean basin (e.g., Reynolds 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0077">2007</a>; Domingues

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial and temporal scales of 377 highly cited ocean change studies were examined after laboratory studies were removed. Both spatial and temporal scales varied greatly among the physical/chemical discipline and biological subdisciplines, making it difficult to detect trends in the data beyond the predominance of physical and chemical studies at the largest spatial scales (Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0002">2</a>a, Table 
  <a rid="gcb12978-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#gcb12978-tbl-0002">2</a>). Nonparametric analysis indicated a significant difference in the distributions of both spatial (Kruskal–Wallis test, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt; 0.001) and temporal (Kruskal–Wallis test, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt; 0.001) scales across disciplines. A cluster analysis revealed two distinct clusters based on both the temporal and spatial scale factors shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0002">2</a>a. These two clusters were statistically different in terms of study area and duration (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt; 0.001; Fig. 
  <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0002">2</a>b). The ‘small‐scale’ cluster (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 195) was primarily comprised of ocean change studies that occurred at smaller spatial scales (median = 100 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) and over shorter durations (median = 7 years). The ‘large‐scale’ cluster (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 163) was comprised of studies that occurred at larger spatial scales (median = 1.4 × 10
  <span class="sup">7</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) and over longer durations (median = 31 years). Nearly three quarters of studies in the large‐scale cluster were from the physical/chemical discipline, while the remaining one‐quarter was predominately comprised of vertebrate studies (18%). In contrast, 84% of the studies in the small‐scale cluster were from the biological subdisciplines: benthic communities (33%), vertebrates (31%), and plankton communities (20%).

Highly cited plankton studies were conducted over the shortest temporal scales with a median duration of approximately 1 year. While study durations were primarily ≤1 year for archaeo‐ and bacterioplankton, durations were often several years for phyto‐, virio‐ and zooplankton studies. For benthic communities, seagrass studies were of the shortest duration and coral reef studies were the longest, with nearly half of the coral reef studies lasting a decade or more. Vertebrate studies were typically of longer duration than studies of plankton or benthos and exhibited relatively less variation. The longest temporal scales occurred among the physical/chemical oceanography themes, with studies of oxygen, sea level height, and sea surface temperature (SST) often lasting several decades. Approximate study areas ranged from the smallest (0.002 km

  <span class="sup">2</span>, but a few studies of viruses were conducted over the largest spatial scales (multiregional to global). Zooplankton studies incorporated large‐scale continuously sampled plankton studies. With the exception of coral reef and some kelp forest studies, benthic communities papers tended to cover the smallest study areas. Marine vertebrate studies were of intermediate spatial scales. Studies of mammals and fish were of similarly large spatial scales and averaged two orders of magnitude larger than studies on marine birds and turtles. Consistent with the temporal data, physical/chemical studies typically had the largest spatial scales, often spanning areas more than an order of magnitude larger than other studies in other subdisciplines.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined 545 biological responses from the 311 highly cited studies investigating potential biological changes (Table 
   <a rid="gcb12978-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#gcb12978-tbl-0001">1</a>). Nearly 30% of these responses were measured in laboratory settings, but this varied greatly among biological subdisciplines and themes. For example, &gt;50% of the biological responses among fish, archaeo‐, bacterio‐, and phytoplankton were measured in the laboratory compared to ≤5% for mangroves, birds, mammals, and turtles, clearly reflecting differences in tractability of experimental manipulations. For 85% of the biological changes examined in our database, the authors concluded that their results could be attributed to physical or chemical changes in the marine environment. Other factors, such as anthropogenic activities (e.g., fishing) or habitat degradation, were sometimes considered. It was not the goal of this review to assess confidence in the attribution of climate change impacts on marine systems, although other studies have addressed this issue extensively (e.g., Poloczanska 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified 11 categories of primary physical and chemical stressors among the biological response studies: atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate indices (e.g., Pacific decadal oscillation), dissolved oxygen, ocean acidification (e.g., pH, alkalinity, pCO
   <sub>2</sub>), salinity, sea ice, sea level height, storms and precipitation, temperature (including SST, bottom temperature, or occasionally air temperature), upwelling processes, and secondary effects of physical changes (e.g., changes in physical habitat due to changes in temperature and chemistry). Most studies examined a response to a single stressor (59%; Fig. 
   <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0004">4</a>). Two stressors were occasionally studied (30%), and three or more were rarely studied (11%). Vertebrate studies examined multiple stressors more frequently than the other two biological subdisciplines. There was no association between the number of stressors examined and year of publication (Fig. 
   <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0004">4</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most frequent primary stressor considered among all three biological subdisciplines was temperature (44%; Fig. 
   <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0005">5</a>a), as found in Poloczanska

   <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0071">2013</a>). Ocean acidification (‘OA’) was the second most common primary stressor studied (36%). While the effects of OA were studied across all three biological subdisciplines, it was primarily examined in studies of benthic communities. Studies considering the effects of sea ice were largely focused on vertebrates. The other eight primary stressors constituted &lt;10% of the biological response studies with salinity, upwelling, and dissolved oxygen being the least studied stressors. Laboratory studies were used to examine the biological responses of a variety of stressors, including climate indices, dissolved oxygen, acidification, salinity, and temperature. Laboratory experiments involving OA were particularly common (65% of laboratory studies), followed by temperature (28%).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Primary stressors associated with each biological theme varied considerably (Fig. 
   <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0005">5</a>b). Temperature was the main stressor examined in plankton communities (61%) and was commonly examined across all benthic communities (35%) and vertebrate (45%) themes. Within benthic communities, the mangrove theme was unique in largely focusing on the effects of sea level height. Moreover, mangroves were the only theme for which atmospheric carbon dioxide was considered; this could be because they are directly vulnerable to both marine and atmospheric stressors. With the exception of mangroves, OA was the main stressor examined in benthic communities (52%). In particular, more than 50% of the rocky/sandy bottom and coral reef studies examined biological responses to OA. In contrast, fish studies were the only vertebrate theme investigating OA, all of which were conducted in the laboratory. With the exception of sea turtles, all vertebrate themes examined sea ice as a stressor, with mammal studies in particular having a strong focus on sea ice impacts (88% of mammal studies).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A variety of responses were examined across each of the biological themes within eight general categories: reproductive fitness (e.g., number of offspring produced), physiological effects (e.g., calcification rate, stress hormone response), phenological shifts, changes in distribution or range shift, dietary effects (e.g., body condition, diet, foraging preferences), changes in community structure (e.g., species composition), behavioral effects (e.g., antipredator response), or changes in population abundance and demography (e.g., recruitment rate, number of individuals). A single study examined evolutionary adaptation as a function of change in population growth (i.e., Lohbeck 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
   <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0053">2012</a>), which was included as a demographic response. Physiological changes (31%) and changes in abundance (30%) were most frequently reported (Fig. 
   <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0006">6</a>), followed by shifts in reproductive fitness (12%). The remaining five categories each constituted &lt;10% of the responses reported. Physiological responses were most frequently measured in benthic communities, and nearly half (47%) were measured in the laboratory. Abundance studies were more evenly divided among the biological subdisciplines (Fig. 
   <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0006">6</a>a) and were examined by all themes, but with varying frequency (Fig. 
   <a rid="gcb12978-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#gcb12978-fig-0006">6</a>b). Notably, changes in abundance were the main response studied by all themes in plankton communities. Dietary effects were not considered in any of the benthic communities studies included in this review, yet nearly all plankton and vertebrate studies examined dietary effects. Vertebrate studies exhibited the greatest diversity of biological response types, with turtle and bird studies often focusing on reproductive success and phenology more than any other themes.
