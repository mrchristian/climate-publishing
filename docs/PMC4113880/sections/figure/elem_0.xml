 <p>Note: Impacts are identified in eight health-related sectors based on assessment of the literature and expert judgments by authors of Chapter 11 of IPCC WGII AR5 [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-11-07347">1</a>]. The width of the slices indicates in a qualitative way the relative importance in terms of burden of ill-health globally at present and should not be considered completely independent. Impact levels are presented for the near-term era of committed climate change (2030–2040), in which projected levels of global mean temperature increases do not diverge substantially across emissions scenarios. For some sectors, e.g., vector-borne diseases, heat/cold stress, and agricultural production and under-nutrition, there may be benefits to health in some areas, but the net impact is expected to be negative. Estimated impacts are also presented for the longer-term era of climate options (2080–2100), for global mean temperature increase of 4 °C above preindustrial levels, which could potentially be avoided by vigorous mitigation efforts taken soon. For each timeframe, impact levels are estimated for the current state of adaptation and for a hypothetical highly adapted state, indicated by different colours.
