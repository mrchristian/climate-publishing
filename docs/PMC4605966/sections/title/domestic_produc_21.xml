  <a rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig11">11</a> shows the estimation procedure for volume of production from domestic forests within HWP consumption and stock volume as relates to the production approach. Steps (1)–(4) were followed to arrive at estimates for each region and each future scenario. Both domestically produced and imported wood is used in HWP consumption for building construction, furniture, and paper. However, wooden piles and guardrails are generally made from wood produced from domestic forests, so it was assumed that only domestically produced wood was used in civil engineering. Estimates were uniformly converted into roundwood terms, and the roundwood conversion coefficients for each HWP were as follows: for sawnwood, 1.570 m
  <span class="sup">3</span>-roundwood m
  <span class="sup">−3</span>-sawnwood; for plywood, 1.618 m
  <span class="sup">3</span>-roundwood m
  <span class="sup">−3</span>-plywood; and for paper, 3.300 m
  <span class="sup">3</span>-roundwood t
  <span class="sup">−1</span>-paper [

    <p>The volume of roundwood and cylindrical poles production for civil engineering in each region was taken from the volume of domestically produced roundwood indicated in the Future scenarios section.</p>

    <p>The remaining domestic roundwood production volume was distributed as production volume for sawnwood, plywood and chips used in building construction, furniture, and paper. The relevant proportions were set at sawnwood-use 60 %, plywood-use 15 %, and chip-use 25 %, with reference to past actual values [

    <p>Production volume of sawnwood and plywood derived from domestic roundwood was distributed among production for building construction and for furniture. Relevant proportions of HWP consumption attributable to building construction and to furniture production mentioned in the HWP consumption volume and stock section were used. Moreover, the volume of chip production derived for domestic roundwood was allocated exclusively to paper.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>HWP import volume or roundwood import volume was assumed to be what remains when the volume of sawnwood, plywood, and chip production derived from domestic roundwood is deducted from the HWP consumption volume. However, since this study used the production approach to account for the carbon storage in HWPs, imports were not taken into consideration.</p>
