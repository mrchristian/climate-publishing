 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the material substitution effect for building construction, civil engineering, and furniture production, the volume of the life-cycle reduction in carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption attributable to the substitution of HWPs for non-wooden materials was evaluated. However, it is necessary to determine a figure for the volume of HWP substitution for non-wooden materials. Thus, the BAU scenario was taken as a baseline, and the increase in HWP volumes in the Mod and the Agg scenarios as compared to the BAU scenario were taken to be the volume of substitution for non-wooden materials. For building construction, civil engineering, and furniture production, the annual carbon emissions reduction (tC year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) attributable to material substitution was evaluated by multiplying, respectively, the increase in the floor area of new wooden building construction (m
  <span class="sup">2</span> year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and the increase in the consumption of each HWP (m
  <span class="sup">3</span> year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), by the carbon emissions reduction intensity (kgC m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, kgC m
  <span class="sup">−3</span>). The carbon emissions reduction intensities are shown in Table

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Table

  <span class="sup">−2</span>) was taken from MiLCA [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. It was calculated by subtracting the emission intensity for wooden building (kgC m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>) from the emission intensity for non-wooden building (reinforced concrete, steel reinforced concrete, steel and concrete blocks) (kgC m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>), from the weighted average, based on 2013 building construction floor space (m

  <span class="sup">−2</span>) was subtracted from the average value (kgC m

  <span class="sup">−1</span>) was subtracted from the emission intensity for metal guardrails (kgC m

  <span class="sup">−1</span>) was subtracted from the emission intensity for metal furniture (kgC item
