 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has indicated that forests and harvested wood products (HWPs) contribute heavily to global carbon cycles [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. HWPs mitigate climate change via a carbon storage effect, a material substitution effect (a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels in material production, transportation, etc., as a result of the substitution of other materials with HWPs), and an energy substitution effect (the substitution of fossil fuels as a result of the energy use of HWPs) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">IPCC and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have been discussing various methods of calculating the carbon balance of HWPs, including the IPCC default approach, the stock change approach, the atmospheric flow approach, the stock change approach domestic use, and the production approach [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. As a result of these discussions, since the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (i.e., since 2013), the change in the carbon storage volume of HWPs has been included in the calculation of each country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sinks. A modified production approach has been adopted to calculate GHG emissions and sinks, which solely includes the change in the carbon storage volume of domestically produced wood from a country’s forests (including wood exported to other countries), as stipulated in Article 3, Paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Kyoto Protocol [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. As a result of such international involvement, research into carbon balancing pertaining to HWPs and consideration of relevant climate change mitigation strategies are increasingly growing in significance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior research has estimated and evaluated the carbon balancing of HWPs globally [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>], in EU countries [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>], and in specific countries such as the United States [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>], Canada [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>], and Slovekia [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Other studies have conducted an integrated carbon balance assessment of forests and HWPs worldwide [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>] and in the United States [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>], Canada [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Looking specifically at Japan, Tsunetsugu and Tonosaki [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>], and Hashimoto and Moriguchi [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>] have estimated the climate change mitigation effect, and carbon balance relating to HWPs for the entire country from a macro viewpoint. Meanwhile, the authors of this study have conducted research [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>] (hereinafter “previous report”) focusing on carbon flow as HWPs circulate between the regions of Japan and on how carbon storage is distributed among the regions. In the previous report, we divided the country into east, central, and west Japan, as shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, and constructed a carbon balance estimation model (hereinafter “previous model”) that takes into account the flow of HWPs between these regions. In addition, we estimated the carbon balance in each region until 2050 based on future scenarios. Clarification of the carbon balance in a region and its potential future changes allow policymakers to engage in a more practical discussion of measures for climate change mitigation using HWPs that take into account the characteristics of each region and related problems (such as carbon emissions arising from HWP transportation between regions and distribution of carbon storage volume in each region) rather than solely pursuing a macro view of the issue in Japan.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objectives</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were two significant problems in our previous report [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. First, despite the importance of the carbon storage volume of domestically produced HWPs from a country’s forests (namely the production approach) to the UNFCCC, our previous model could not indicate the detail of HWPs produced from domestic forests, and therefore an adequate assessment of the carbon storage volume and future changes relating to HWPs derived from domestic production in each region was not possible. Second, for the climate change mitigation effect, only the carbon storage effect and energy substitution effect were targeted, and it was not feasible to address the overall mitigation effect that takes into account the material substitution effect.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, therefore, the first area of concern has been addressed through a number of future scenarios relating to HWPs derived from domestic forests, which consider the future of the domestic forestry industry and of HWP use from various viewpoints. Furthermore, carbon storage volume and its future changes are estimated using the production approach with country-specific methods [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. The second point of concern has been addressed through the evaluation of the overall climate change mitigation effect, which takes into account the material substitution effect. The initial projection year was also changed from 2005 in the previous model to 2014, to include the most recent figures available. As a result, it was possible to reflect in the projections the impact on HWP supply and demand of such things as the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 and the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011. Further considerations included the civil engineering field as an application for HWPs and the use of logging residue for energy generation. As a result, the problems with the previous model were resolved, giving rise to an improved comprehensive model (hereinafter “new model”). Based on the new model, the HWP carbon balance in each region of Japan was evaluated, and the overall climate change mitigation effect to 2050 was estimated, in line with multiple future scenarios. For future studies, this new model plays the part of an integrated carbon balance model for the Japanese forest sector combining forests and HWPs [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Structure of the model</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The new model for evaluating the HWP carbon balance used in this study is outlined in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>. Its basic structure follows that of the previous model. The structure formulates (1) HWP flow, from roundwood production to sawnwood (including glued laminated lumber and laminated veneer lumber), plywood (including wood-based panels such as particle board and fiberboard) and chip production and HWP consumption (building construction, civil engineering, furniture, paper) and to energy use (logging residue, processing residue, waste wood); and (2) HWP stock (building construction, civil engineering, furniture, paper). Moreover, the model evaluates the climate change mitigation effect based on the carbon balance implied by this HWP flow and stock.

   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the volume of Japanese HWP imports is very large (71 % of the volume of the overall HWP supply in 2013) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], the model targets not only domestically produced HWPs but also imported HWPs. However, when assessing carbon balance, the carbon storage in HWP derived from only domestic forests (excluding imports) and its future changes, are estimated using the production approach. The volume of Japanese HWP exports has remained below 3 % of the volume of overall HWP demand for more than 50 years [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], and the export volume for each application has been unclear. According to the 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the Kyoto Protocol of the IPCC [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>], the annual change in carbon storage in HWPs is assumed to be zero (instantaneous oxidation) when transparent and verifiable activity data are not available. Therefore, HWP exports were not taken into consideration.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the previous model, there were two future scenarios focusing only on HWP consumption volume. However, in the new model, several scenarios were investigated relating to domestic roundwood production, HWP consumption volume, and the volume of energy use. These combinations are shown in Table

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As regards the domestic roundwood production volume, we explored five future scenarios [in ascending order of volume: resource conservation (Con), business as usual (BAU), moderate increase in harvesting (Mod), in accordance with the Basic Plan for Forest and Forestry of Japanese government (Plan), in accordance with the forest owners’ intentions (Int)] created by Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. In the resource conservation scenario, the volume of roundwood production declines in the future, and forest resources are conserved, with only limited harvesting of wood. In the BAU scenario, even if the future composition of forests increases, the harvesting area and the afforestation area remain unchanged at their actual recent-year level, and the forests continue to age. In the moderate harvesting increase scenario, older trees are harvested, and roundwood production volume is at least double its current level by 2050. In the government plan scenario the future production of roundwood is aggressively pursued in line with the Japanese government’s Basic Plan for Forest and Forestry. In the forest owners’ intentions scenario, which relies upon the results of a survey on the intentions of the forest owners affiliated with the forestry cooperatives, 15–30 % of planted trees are harvested in the 20-year period 2011–2030, and 25–30 % during 2031–2050. Roundwood production volume under these scenarios was estimated for each prefecture and the three regions; the national production is presented in Fig.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three scenarios were considered for HWP consumption volume, namely business as usual (BAU), moderate promotion of usage (Mod), and aggressive promotion of usage (Agg). Under the BAU scenario, the proportion of wood used in building construction, the proportion of wood used in furniture, and the volume of HWPs consumed in civil engineering projects all remain unchanged at the current level until 2050. Under the moderate usage promotion scenario, the proportion of wood used in building construction and in furniture making increases from 35 to 50 % by 2050 and the volume of HWPs consumed in civil engineering projects increases to 3 Mm
   <span class="sup">3</span> by 2050 from the current 1 Mm
   <span class="sup">3</span>. Under the aggressive usage promotion scenario, the proportion of wood used in building construction and in furniture making increases to 70 % by 2050, and the volume of HWPs consumed in civil engineering projects increases to 6 Mm
   <span class="sup">3</span> by 2050. No distinction was made between scenarios for the volume of paper consumption, with no change in per-person paper consumption anticipated through 2050. Details on HWP consumption volume are explained in the “

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three similar scenarios were also assumed for the volume of energy usage, namely business as usual (BAU), moderate promotion of usage (Mod), and aggressive promotion of usage (Agg). The BAU scenario entails no change in energy usage until 2050 with the current proportion of logging residue, processing residue, and waste wood. In the moderate usage promotion scenario, in 2050, in addition to the current energy-usage proportion, half of the unutilized proportion is used. In the aggressive usage promotion scenario, in 2050, in addition to the current energy-usage proportion, the whole of the unutilized proportion is used. Details of the volume of energy usage are explained in the “
