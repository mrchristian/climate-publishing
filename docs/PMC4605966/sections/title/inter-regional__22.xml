 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The flow of HWPs derived from domestic forests between regions of Japan (east, central, and west) was estimated, with reference to past actual flow data [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>]. The flow of roundwood from its location to the production location of resulting sawnwood, plywood, or chips was taken to be entirely intra-regional, rather than inter-regional. Looking at the flow of sawnwood from the location of its production to the location of HWP consumption, 15 % of consumption volume in central Japan was taken to be from east Japan, 70 % from central Japan, and 15 % from west Japan. Looking at the flow of plywood from the location of production to the location of HWP consumption, 15 % of consumption volume in central Japan was taken to be from east Japan, 75 % from central Japan, and 10 % from west Japan. The flow of chips from the location of their production to the location of paper product consumption was taken to be intra-regional, rather than inter-regional. Looking at the flow of paper products from the location of their production to the location of paper product consumption, 25 % of consumption volume in central Japan was taken to be from east Japan, 55 % from central Japan, and 20 % from west Japan. In addition, it was assumed that logging residue, processing residue, and waste wood were used for energy in the region where they were generated, and they were not included in consideration of inter-regional flow.
