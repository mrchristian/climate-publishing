 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also find that some—but not all—of the factors for social vulnerability and health susceptibility influence whether or not people say they know their climate change health risks (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14994-t004" href="#ijerph-12-14994-t004">Table 4</a>). Of the more than 2000 survey respondents, 183 said that they did not know whether they and their household were vulnerable to the health effects of climate change. Those who are at higher health risk from climate change—such as those with medical conditions, women, and people from communities of color—are more likely to say they know whether they are at risk. A number of characteristics not associated with greater risk—knowledge (level of education, and information about state climate health impacts) and income—also decrease the likelihood that someone will say they do not know whether they and their household are at risk from the health effects of climate change.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predictors in the logistic regression model all have odds ratios of less than 1, signifying that as each of these variables increases, individuals are less likely to report “don’t know” to personal and household climate change health vulnerability (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14994-t004" href="#ijerph-12-14994-t004">Table 4</a>). As each measure increases by one, holding all other variables constant, the change in the odds that the respondent will say they do not know, 
  <span class="italic">versus</span> they say they know, is 0.55 for females, 0.81 for income, 0.69 for education, 0.62 for African Americans, 0.33 for Hispanics and Latinos, 0.72 for medical conditions, and 0.81 for Maryland climate health impact perceptions. Another way of saying this is that these groups are each less likely than their comparison groups to say that they do not know whether they are vulnerable. Women are 81% less likely than men; those with higher income levels are successively 23% less likely; those with higher education levels are successively 45% less likely; African Americans are 61% less likely compared to other races; Hispanics and Latinos are 199% less likely compared to those not of those ethnicities; those with higher levels of medical conditions and/or disabilities are successively 39% less likely; and those with higher perceptions of Maryland climate health impact are successively 24% less likely. The results should be interpreted with caution, however, as logistic regression has well-known problems in modeling rare events [
