 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.1. Data Collection and Treatment</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data for this study were collected as part of a survey fielded from 28 March to 4 June 2013 with 6401 households in Maryland. The questionnaire was sent to residents by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The instrument included measures of health and environmental risk perceptions, preferences for energy sources, pro-environmental behaviors, state climate and energy policy preferences, and climate change beliefs. The survey consisted of 55 questions and took approximately 20 min to complete. Using stratified sampling, households were randomly selected from a Survey Sampling International address database of residents for each of four regions of the state (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14994-t005" href="#ijerph-12-14994-t005">Table S1</a>). The survey was fielded from 28 March to 4 June 2013. Each household was sent up to four mailings: An announcement letter introducing the survey (March 28), a copy of the survey with a $2 bill thank you (April 1), a reminder postcard (April 13), and a follow-up survey (April 29). In order to achieve randomization of respondents within each household, the person with the most recent birthday was asked to complete the survey. The methodology is based on a commonly used mail survey technique developed by Dillman and colleagues [
  <a rid="B28-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-12-14994">28</a>]. The study was reviewed by Institutional Review Boards for both George Mason University and Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In weighting the dataset for public crosstabular reporting, 146 respondents were dropped due to lack of regional, gender, education or age identification (6.4% of the initial sample of 2272). The final sample of respondents was 2126 with a response rate of 38%. This response rate compares favorably to other similar university studies using the same methodology [
  <a rid="B29-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-12-14994">29</a>]. While survey response is declining across all methodologies with below 10% response rates normative for online panels and telephone samples utilized by researchers [
  <a rid="B30-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-12-14994">30</a>,
  <a rid="B31-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-12-14994">31</a>,
  <a rid="B32-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-12-14994">32</a>], mail surveys have seen less of a drop [
  <a rid="B33-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-12-14994">33</a>]. Mail survey response rates can achieve between 40%–70% response rates when incentives of $5 or more are included and the survey sponsor is well-known to the respondents [
  <a rid="B33-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-12-14994">33</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To accommodate the regional sampling design and the causal nature of the study, the data were weighted solely to readjust for state population density distributions [
  <a rid="B34-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-12-14994">34</a>]. Missing data ranged between 1%–9.5% for each of the independent variables in the analysis (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14994-t006" href="#ijerph-12-14994-t006">Table S2</a>), and between 1.2%–2.6% for the dependent variable. All missing survey data, with the exception of race and ethnicity, were substituted using hot deck imputation, a strategy for handling missing data that is widely employed by government statistics agencies, survey organizations, and academic researchers [
  <a rid="B35-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-12-14994">35</a>]. In hot deck imputation, respondents matched on a set of variables to the case with the missing value are randomly sorted; the missing value is replaced with that of the nearest neighbor [
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-12-14994">36</a>]. This single imputation technique is distinct from multiple imputation [
  <a rid="B37-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-12-14994">37</a>]. The matched variables were gender, age and education, for which there was no missing data but expected differences on attitudinal measures and income. For more information on hot deck imputation with application to public health see Hawthorne and Elliott [
  <a rid="B38-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-12-14994">38</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sample bias can be assessed by comparing sample characteristics to those of the population, testing for differences between early and late waves of responders and extrapolation of linear trends over time, and contrasting the characteristics of respondents to non-respondents on variables of research relevance [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-12-14994">39</a>]. We performed two tests for bias. We compared the sample to known Census distributions for the state and Gallup reports of political ideology frequencies, and split 20% of the sample into early and late responders on the primary variable of interest—perceived vulnerability to climate change health risk—to test for differences between the groups. We do not have data on non-respondents, but late survey responders can be assumed to resemble non-respondents and function as a proxy [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-12-14994">39</a>]. Testing for mean differences between the first 10% of responders (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 212) and last 10% (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 212), we find no statistically significant difference in the dependent variable (
  <span class="italic">M</span>
  <sub>first10%</sub> = −0.12; 
  <span class="italic">M</span>
  <sub>last10%</sub> = 0.01; 
  <span class="italic">t</span>(422) = −1.40, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.16). Compared to U.S. Census distributions for Maryland, the final sample is slightly older, more female, and better educated (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14994-t001" href="#ijerph-12-14994-t001">Table 1</a>). The differences in sample characteristics from the known population values suggest at possible bias in the regression estimates, but the finding that there appears to be insignificant differences between respondents and a proxy for non-respondents on the primary variable of interest implies that these are likely to be limited.
