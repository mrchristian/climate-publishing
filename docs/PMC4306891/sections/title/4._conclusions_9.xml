 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study screened different kinds of climate change-sensitive disease by defining a new statistical indicator, "Relative Sensitivity". A statistical significance test for this indicator helps to identify a significant change in the relationship between disease and climate variables. The application results in Anhui province found a significant sensitivity of the changes of climatic variables, such as temperature, precipitation and absolute humidity, to the epidemiology of many diseases. In detail, from 2004 to 2010, in more than 50% of the effective counties of Anhui Province, dysentery and hepatitis A were both sensitive to changes in precipitation and absolute humidity; HFM, malaria, influenza and meningitis were all sensitive to changes in temperature and absolute humidity; typhoid fever and schistosomiasis were both sensitive to changes in temperature, precipitation and absolute humidity; hemorrhagic fever was sensitive to a change in absolute humidity. As novel evidence, this research shows that absolute humidity has a critical influence on many observed infectious diseases in Anhui province, including dysentery, HFM, hepatitis A, hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, malaria, meningitis, influenza and schistosomiasis. Moreover, some infectious diseases are more sensitive to climate change in rural areas than that in urban areas. </p>
