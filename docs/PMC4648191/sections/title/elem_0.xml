 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is now halfway through the second decade of the 21 
  <span class="sup">st</span> century, and climate change impact has emerged as a “hot topic” in biodiversity research. In the early decades of the discipline of conservation biology (1970s and 1980s), effort was focused on studying and mitigating the four principal drivers of extinction risk since the turn of the 16 
  <span class="sup">th</span> century, colourfully framed by Diamond 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a>
  </span> as the “evil quartet”: habitat destruction, overhunting (or overexploitation of resources), introduced species, and chains of extinctions (including trophic cascades and co-extinctions). Recent work has also emphasised the importance of synergies among drivers of endangerment 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>
  </span>. But the momentum to understand how other aspects of global change (such as a disrupted climate system and pollution) add to, and reinforce, these threats has built since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a>
  </span> of 2001 and 2007 and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">4</a>
  </span> in 2005.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scientific studies on the effects of climate change on biodiversity have proliferated in recent decades. A 
  <span class="italic">Web of Science</span> ( 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://webofscience.com" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">webofscience.com</span>) query on the term “biodiversity AND (climate change)”, covering the 14 complete years of the 21 
  <span class="sup">st</span> century, shows the peer-reviewed literature matching this search term has grown from just 87 papers in 2001 to 1,377 in 2014. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Figure 1</a> illustrates that recent scientific interest in climate change-related aspects of biodiversity research has outpaced—in relative terms—the baseline trend of interest in other areas of biodiversity research (i.e., matching the query “biodiversity NOT (climate change)”), with climate-related research rising from 5.5% of biodiversity papers in 2001 to 16.8% in 2014.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interest in this field of research seems to have been driven by a number of concerns. First, there is an increasing societal and scientific consensus on the need to measure, predict (and, ultimately, mitigate) the impact of anthropogenic climate change 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a>
  </span>, linked to the rise of industrial fossil-fuel combustion and land-use change 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>
  </span>. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem transformations, in particular, have been highlighted as possibly being amongst the most sensitive of Earth’s systems to global change 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>, 
   <a rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a>
  </span>. Second, there is increasing attention given to quantifying the reinforcing (or occasionally stabilising) feedbacks between climate change and other impacts of human development, such as agricultural activities and land clearing, invasive species, exploitation of natural resources, and biotic interactions 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>, 
   <a rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-9">9</a>
  </span>. Third, there has been a trend towards increased accessibility of climate change data and predictions at finer spatio-temporal resolutions, making it more feasible to do biodiversity climate research
