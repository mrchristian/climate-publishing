 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current emphasis on leveraging large databases for evidence of species responses to observed (recent) climate change is likely to wane as existing datasets are scrutinised repeatedly. This suggests to us that future research will be forced to move increasingly towards the logistically more challenging experimental manipulations (laboratory, mesocosm, and field-based). The likelihood of this shift in emphasis is reinforced by the recent trend towards mechanistic models in preference to correlative approaches 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-41">41</a>
  </span>. Such approaches arguably offer the greatest potential to yield highly novel insights, especially for predicting and managing the outcomes of future climate-ecosystem interactions that have no contemporary or historical analogue. Along with this work would come an increasing need for systematic reviews and associated meta-analysis, to summarise these individual studies quantitatively and use the body of experiments to test hypotheses.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Technological advances will also drive this field forward. This includes the development of open-source software and function libraries that facilitate and standardise routine tasks like validation and sensitivity analysis of projection or statistical models

   <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">43</a>
  </span>, as well as improved access to data layers from large spatio-temporal datasets like ensemble climate forecasts 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">10</a>
  </span> and palaeoclimatic hindcasts 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-44">44</a>
  </span>. An increasing emphasis on cloud-based storage and use of off-site high-performance parallel computing infrastructure will make it realistic for researchers to undertake computationally intensive tasks 
  <span class="sup">

  </span> from their desktop.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These approaches are beginning to emerge, and a few papers on these topics already appear in the highly cited paper list ( 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). This includes the innovative exposure of coral populations to varying carbon dioxide concentrations, and the meta-analyses of tundra plant response to experimental warming 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-45">45</a>
  </span> and marine organisms to ocean chemistry 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">27</a>
  </span>. Such work must also be underpinned by improved models of the underlying mechanisms and dynamic processes, ideally using multi-species frameworks that make use of ensemble forecasting methods for improved incorporation of scenario and climate model uncertainty 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">10</a>
  </span>. Such an approach can account better for biotic interactions 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-41">41</a>
  </span>
  <span class="italic">via</span> individual-based and physiologically explicit “bottom-up” models of adaptive responses 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-31">31</a>
  </span>. Lastly, there must be a greater emphasis on using genetic information to integrate eco-evolutionary processes into biodiversity models 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">46</a>
  </span>, and on improving methods for making the best use of retrospective knowledge from palaeoecological data
