 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The responses of the control group about scientists’ views on climate change reveal that the public underestimates the degree of scientific consensus, as measured by the survey of scientists we use to provide information to the treated group [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref001">1</a>]. In particular, respondents in the control group believe that only 72% of scientists agree that global warming is a process that is already underway (different from 95%, the percentage of scientists agreeing with the same statement, at 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), that only 69% of scientists believe that human activities are accelerating global warming (different from 88% at 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), and that 32% of scientists would say that there is no need for immediate policy decisions (different from 9% at 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also find a great degree of skepticism toward the information shown to the HI treatment group. Almost two-thirds (65%) of the treated group did not think the information from the scientist survey was accurately representing the views of all scientists who were knowledgeable about climate change. Only about 20% of the skeptical respondents thought that participating scientists misstated their true views. The skepticism largely stems from the concern that the scientists polled (“US scientists who published in top journals”) were not representative of all scientists knowledgeable about climate change: 85% of skeptical respondents chose that as one of the reasons for thinking that the information was inaccurate. Being unemployed, liberal or conservative (versus moderate) were the only significant predictors of not trusting the information from the survey of US climate scientists.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Those in the treatment group who were skeptical of the information also believed that scientists were less certain about climate change than the control group (by about 4 percentage points, on average). On the other hand, the control group did not think that there would be significant differences in the answers by the following two groups of scientists: (a) all scientists knowledgeable about climate change, and (b) only US scientists who published in top journals. The fact that the treated respondents reported that (b) would not be representative of (a) while the control group does not expect there to be significant differences between them suggests that some people in our sample may suffer from “self-justification” bias. “Self-justification” refers to the phenomenon of justifying one’s behavior or beliefs when facing evidence that is inconsistent with them [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref020">20</a>]. For example, in our case, the self-justification bias may explain why some respondents continue to believe that climate change is not caused by humans when facing the fact that most scientists believe that it is. Self-justification bias may also be responsible for the disconnect described above: one way to justify continuing to believe that climate change is not occurring or is not caused by humans in light of the scientific consensus information is to claim that the survey does not accurately reflect all scientists’ views. Alternatively, it may be that learning about US climate scientists’ views on climate change caused some of the treated respondents to rationally conclude that these scientists’ views differ from the views of all scientists knowledgeable about climate change.
