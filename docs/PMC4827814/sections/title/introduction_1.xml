 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change generates much public disagreement, despite the broad consensus of scientists that it is a real phenomenon caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref003">3</a>]. Because climate change is a high-profile issue, implementing meaningful policies to address it will almost surely require a significant degree of public consensus. However, only 50% of US adults believe that climate change is mostly man-made, compared to 87% of scientists [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref003">3</a>]. Moreover, differences between the beliefs of liberals and conservatives are stark and have recently widened. In 2001, 60% of Democrats and about 50% of Republicans believed the effects of global warming have already begun to happen; by 2008, that figure was 75% of Democrats compared to 42% of Republicans [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref004">4</a>]. Thus, the current gap between the consensus among scientists and the public consensus on this issue is driven largely by conservatives [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref003">3</a>]. In the US Congress, one political party can prevent another from passing legislation unless the latter has a supermajority. Because of this, the ideological divide on climate change can hinder public policy even if that policy has the support of the majority of Americans. Thus, whether and how the overall public consensus on this issue can be brought closer to that of scientists, and how the ideological divide can be bridged are both important public policy questions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a strong correlation between individuals’ own views on global warming and their beliefs about scientists’ views on the topic [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref005">5</a>], but whether this means that people rely on their perceptions of scientists’ beliefs to form their own is unclear. For example, it is possible that people misstate their beliefs about scientists’ views to justify their own opinion about climate change: an experiment [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref006">6</a>] shows that subjects who make selfish choices in social dilemmas are also likely to report inaccurate beliefs to justify their own selfishness. However, the absence of people’s disagreement with perceived scientific views suggests another (not necessarily mutually exclusive) hypothesis: that beliefs can be affected by providing respondents with objective information about the scientific consensus. In this paper, we investigate whether such information can steer the public toward a consensus on the science of global climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted a survey experiment to estimate the causal effects of providing objective information about climate scientists’ views on climate change on respondents’ own beliefs and their willingness to contribute to causes that aim to counter climate change. The treatment group received precise information about the beliefs of US scientists who have published articles in top climate journals [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref001">1</a>], while the control group received no information. A third group received vague information about the scientific consensus to test whether simply drawing subjects’ attention to the fact that a consensus exists without providing specific evidence would have a meaningful impact on stated beliefs. We then assessed the treated group’s perception of the credibility of the information and elicited all respondents’ beliefs about various aspects of climate change. Finally, we followed up with all respondents 6 months after the initial treatment without any additional interventions to test whether the treatment effect persisted.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research has shown that providing objective information alters behavior in contexts other than climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref008">8</a>]. Although some experimental studies on the factors affecting beliefs about climate change exist [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref009">9</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref013">13</a>], ours is one of the first to test the effects of providing objective information about the scientific consensus, to assess the public’s perception of the credibility of such information, and to gauge the persistence of the effects over time. An exception is a recent information experiment conducted around the same time as this study [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref014">14</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref015">15</a>]. Researchers have argued that familiarity with the scientific consensus is a necessary prerequisite for the public to make informed decisions [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref016">16</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref017">17</a>]. However, whether or not information provision would actually affect beliefs is unclear if there is substantial mistrust toward information about climate change in general [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref016">16</a>]. Our survey experiment helps illuminate the importance of both objective information and trust in communications about climate change.
